title: 'High-dimensional Mixed Graphical Model with Ordinal Data: Parameter Estimation
  and Statistical Inference'
abstract: We consider parameter estimation and statistical inference of high-dimensional
  undirected graphical models for mixed data comprising both ordinal and continuous
  variables. We propose a flexible model called Latent Mixed Gaussian Copula Model
  that simultaneously deals with such mixed data by assuming that the observed ordinal
  variables are generated by latent variables. For parameter estimation, we introduce
  a convenient rank-based ensemble approach to estimate the latent correlation matrix,
  which can be subsequently applied to recover the latent graph structure. In addition,
  based on the ensemble estimator, we develop test statistics via a pseudo-likelihood
  approach to quantify the uncertainty associated with the low dimensional components
  of high-dimensional parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows the consistency of
  the estimator and asymptotic normality of the test statistic. Experiments on simulated
  and real gene expression data are conducted to validate our approach.
