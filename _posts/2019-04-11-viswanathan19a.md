title: Improved Semi-Supervised Learning with Multiple Graphs
abstract: We present a new approach for graph based semi-supervised learning based
  on a multi-component extension to the Gaussian MRF model. This approach models the
  observations on the vertices as jointly Gaussian with an inverse covariance matrix
  that is a weighted linear combination of multiple matrices. Building on randomized
  matrix trace estimation and fast Laplacian solvers, we develop fast and efficient
  algorithms for computing the best-fit (maximum likelihood) model and the predicted
  labels using gradient descent. Our model is considerably simpler, with just tens
  of parameters, and a single hyperparameter, in contrast with state-of-the-art approaches
  using deep learning techniques. Our experiments on benchmark citation networks show
  that the best-fit model estimated by our algorithm leads to significant improvements
  on all datasets compared to baseline models. Further, our performance compares favorably
  with several state-of-the-art methods on these datasets, and is comparable with
  the best performances.
