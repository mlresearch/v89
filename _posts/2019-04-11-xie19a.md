title: Online Decentralized Leverage Score Sampling for Streaming Multidimensional
  Time Series
abstract: Estimating the dependence structure of multidimensional time series data
  in real-time is challenging. With large volumes of streaming data, the problem becomes
  more difficult when the multidimensional data are collected asynchronously across
  distributed nodes, which motivates us to sample representative data points from
  streams. We propose a leverage score sampling (LSS) method for efficient online
  inference of the streaming vector autoregressive (VAR) model. We define the leverage
  score for the streaming VAR model so that the LSS method selects informative data
  points in real-time with statistical guarantees of parameter estimation efficiency.
  Moreover, our LSS method can be directly deployed in an asynchronous decentralized
  environment, e.g., a sensor network without a fusion center, and produce asynchronous
  consensus online parameter estimation over time. By exploiting the temporal dependence
  structure of the VAR model, the LSS method selects samples independently on each
  dimension and thus is able to update the estimation asynchronously. We illustrate
  the effectiveness of the LSS method in synthetic, gas sensor and seismic datasets.
