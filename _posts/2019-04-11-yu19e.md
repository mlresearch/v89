title: 'AutoML from Service Provider’s Perspective: Multi-device, Multi-tenant Model
  Selection with GP-EI'
abstract: 'AutoML has become a popular service that is provided by most leading cloud
  service providers today. In this paper, we focus on the AutoML problem from the
  \emph{service provider’s perspective}, motivated by the following practical consideration:
  When an AutoML service needs to serve {\em multiple users} with {\em multiple devices}
  at the same time, how can we allocate these devices to users in an efficient way?
  We focus on GP-EI, one of the most popular algorithms for automatic model selection
  and hyperparameter tuning, used by systems such as Google Vizer. The technical contribution
  of this paper is the first multi-device, multi-tenant algorithm for GP-EI that is
  aware of \emph{multiple} computation devices and multiple users sharing the same
  set of computation devices. Theoretically, given $N$ users and $M$ devices, we obtain
  a regret bound of $O((\text{\bf {MIU}}(T,K) + M)\frac{N^2}{M})$, where $\text{\bf
  {MIU}}(T,K)$ refers to the maximal incremental uncertainty up to time $T$ for the
  covariance matrix $K$. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on two applications
  of automatic model selection, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms
  the strategy of serving users independently. Moreover, when multiple computation
  devices are available, we achieve near-linear speedup when the number of users is
  much larger than the number of devices.'
