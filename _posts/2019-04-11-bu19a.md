title: 'SMOGS: Social Network Metrics of Game Success'
abstract: In this paper we propose a novel metric of basketball game success, derived
  from a team’s dynamic social network of game play. We combine ideas from random
  effects models for network links with taking a multi-resolution stochastic process
  approach to model passes between teammates. These passes can be viewed as directed
  dynamic relational links in a network. Multiplicative latent factors are introduced
  to study higher-order patterns in players’ interactions that distinguish a successful
  game from a loss. Parameters are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler.
  Results in simulation experiments suggest that the sampling scheme is effective
  in recovering the parameters. We also apply the model to the first high-resolution
  optical tracking data set collected in college basketball games. The learned latent
  factors demonstrate significant differences between players’ passing and receiving
  patterns in a loss, as opposed to a win. Our model is applicable to team sports
  other than basketball, as well as other time-varying network observations.
