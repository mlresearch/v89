title: A Bayesian model for sparse graphs with flexible degree distribution and overlapping
  community structure
abstract: We consider a non-projective class of inhomogeneous random graph models
  with interpretable parameters and a number of interesting asymptotic properties.
  Using the results of Bollobás et al. (2007), we show that i) the class of models
  is sparse and ii) depending on the choice of the parameters, the model is either
  scale-free, with power-law exponent greater than 2, or with an asymptotic degree
  distribution which is power-law with exponential cut-off. We propose an extension
  of the model that can accommodate an overlapping community structure. Scalable posterior
  inference can be performed due to the specific choice of the link probability. We
  present experiments on five different real world networks with up to 100,000 nodes
  and edges, showing that the model can provide a good fit to the degree distribution
  and recovers well the latent community structure.
