title: 'LF-PPL: A Low-Level First Order Probabilistic Programming Language for Non-Differentiable
  Models'
abstract: We develop a new Low-level, First-order Probabilistic Programming LanguageÂ (LF-PPL)
  suited for models containing a mix of continuous, discrete, and/or piecewise-continuous
  variables. The key success of this language and its compilation scheme is in its
  ability to automatically distinguish parameters the density function is discontinuous
  with respect to, while further providing runtime checks for boundary crossings.
  This enables the introduction of new inference engines that are able to exploit
  gradient information, while remaining efficient for models which are not everywhere
  differentiable. We demonstrate this ability by incorporating a discontinuous Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo (DHMC) inference engine that is able to deliver automated and efficient
  inference for non-differentiable models. Our system is backed up by a mathematical
  formalism that ensures that any model expressed in this language has a density with
  measure zero discontinuities to maintain the validity of the inference engine.
