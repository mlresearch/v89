title: A Geometric Perspective on the Transferability of Adversarial Directions
abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning models frequently misclassify inputs that
  have been perturbed in an adversarial manner. Adversarial perturbations generated
  for a given input and a specific classifier often seem to be effective on other
  inputs and even different classifiers. In other words, adversarial perturbations
  seem to transfer between different inputs, models, and even different neural network
  architectures. In this work, we show that in the context of linear classifiers and
  two-layer ReLU networks, there provably exist directions that give rise to adversarial
  perturbations for many classifiers and data points simultaneously. We show that
  these “transferable adversarial directions” are guaranteed to exist for linear separators
  of a given set, and will exist with high probability for linear classifiers trained
  on independent sets drawn from the same distribution. We extend our results to large
  classes of two-layer ReLU networks. We further show that adversarial directions
  for ReLU networks transfer to linear classifiers while the reverse need not hold,
  suggesting that adversarial perturbations for more complex models are more likely
  to transfer to other classifiers. We validate our findings empirically, even for
  deeper ReLU networks.
