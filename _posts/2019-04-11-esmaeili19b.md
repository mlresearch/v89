title: Structured Neural Topic Models for Reviews
abstract: We present Variational Aspect-based Latent Topic Allocation (VALTA), a family
  of autoencoding topic models that learn aspect-based representations of reviews.
  VALTA defines a user-item encoder that maps bag-of-words vectors for combined reviews
  associated with each paired user and item onto structured embeddings, which in turn
  define per-aspect topic weights. We model individual reviews in a structured manner
  by inferring an aspect assignment for each sentence in a given review, where the
  per-aspect topic weights obtained by the user-item encoder serve to define a mixture
  over topics, conditioned on the aspect. The result is an autoencoding neural topic
  model for reviews, which can be trained in a fully unsupervised manner to learn
  topics that are structured into aspects. Experimental evaluation on large number
  of datasets demonstrates that aspects are interpretable, yield higher coherence
  scores than non-structured autoencoding topic model variants, and can be utilized
  to perform aspect-based comparison and genre discovery.
