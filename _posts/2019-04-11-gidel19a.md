title: Negative Momentum for Improved Game Dynamics
abstract: Games generalize the single-objective optimization paradigm by introducing
  different objective functions for different players. Differentiable games often
  proceed by simultaneous or alternating gradient updates. In machine learning, games
  are gaining new importance through formulations like generative adversarial networks
  (GANs) and actor-critic systems. However, compared to single-objective optimization,
  game dynamics is more complex and less understood. In this paper, we analyze gradient-based
  methods with momentum on simple games. We prove that alternating updates are more
  stable than simultaneous updates. Next, we show both theoretically and empirically
  that alternating gradient updates with a negative momentum term achieves convergence
  in a difficult toy adversarial problem, but also on the notoriously difficult to
  train saturating GANs.
