title: A General Framework for Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian
  Processes
abstract: How can we efficiently gather information to optimize an unknown function,
  when presented with multiple, mutually dependent information sources with different
  costs? For example, when optimizing a physical system, intelligently trading off
  computer simulations and real-world tests can lead to significant savings. Existing
  multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization methods, such as multi-fidelity GP-UCB or Entropy
  Search-based approaches, either make simplistic assumptions on the interaction among
  different fidelities or use simple heuristics that lack theoretical guarantees.
  In this paper, we study multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization with complex structural
  dependencies among multiple outputs, and propose MF-MI-Greedy, a principled algorithmic
  framework for addressing this problem. In particular, we model different fidelities
  using additive Gaussian processes based on shared latent relationships with the
  target function. Then we use cost-sensitive mutual information gain for efficient
  Bayesian optimization. We propose a simple notion of regret which incorporates the
  varying cost of different fidelities, and prove that MF-MI-Greedy achieves low regret.
  We demonstrate the strong empirical performance of our algorithm on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets.
