title: Learning Controllable Fair Representations
abstract: Learning data representations that are transferable and are fair with respect
  to certain protected attributes is crucial to reducing unfair decisions while preserving
  the utility of the data. We propose an information-theoretically motivated objective
  for learning maximally expressive representations subject to fairness constraints.
  We demonstrate that a range of existing approaches optimize approximations to the
  Lagrangian dual of our objective. In contrast to these existing approaches, our
  objective allows the user to control the fairness of the representations by specifying
  limits on unfairness. Exploiting duality, we introduce a method that optimizes the
  model parameters as well as the expressiveness-fairness trade-off. Empirical evidence
  suggests that our proposed method can balance the trade-off between multiple notions
  of fairness and achieves higher expressiveness at a lower computational cost.
