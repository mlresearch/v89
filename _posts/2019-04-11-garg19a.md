title: Designing Optimal Binary Rating Systems
abstract: Modern online platforms rely on effective rating systems to learn about
  items. We consider the optimal design of rating systems that collect binary feedback
  after transactions. We make three contributions. First, we formalize the performance
  of a rating system as the speed with which it recovers the true underlying ranking
  on items (in a large deviations sense), accounting for both items’ underlying match
  rates and the platform’s preferences.  Second, we provide an efficient algorithm
  to compute the binary feedback system that yields the highest such performance.
  Finally, we show how this theoretical perspective can be used to empirically design
  an implementable, approximately optimal rating system, and validate our approach
  using real-world experimental data collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
