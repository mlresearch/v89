title: Interpolating between Optimal Transport and MMD using Sinkhorn Divergences
abstract: 'Comparing probability distributions is a fundamental problem in data sciences.
  Simple norms and divergences such as the total variation and the relative entropy
  only compare densities in a point-wise manner and fail to capture the geometric
  nature of the problem. In sharp contrast, Maximum Mean Discrepancies (MMD) and Optimal
  Transport distances (OT) are two classes of distances between measures that take
  into account the geometry of the underlying space and metrize the convergence in
  law.  This paper studies the Sinkhorn divergences, a family of geometric divergences
  that interpolates between MMD and OT. Relying on a new notion of geometric entropy,
  we provide theoretical guarantees for these divergences: positivity, convexity and
  metrization of the convergence in law. On the practical side, we detail a numerical
  scheme that enables the large scale application of these divergences for machine
  learning: on the GPU, gradients of the Sinkhorn loss can be computed for batches
  of a million samples.'
