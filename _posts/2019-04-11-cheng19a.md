title: Accelerating Imitation Learning with Predictive Models
abstract: 'Sample efficiency is critical in solving real-world reinforcement learning
  problems where agent-environment interactions can be costly. Imitation learning
  from expert advice has proved to be an effective strategy for reducing the number
  of interactions required to train a policy. Online imitation learning, which interleaves
  policy evaluation and policy optimization, is a particularly effective technique
  with provable performance guarantees. In this work, we seek to further accelerate
  the convergence rate of online imitation learning, thereby making it more sample
  efficient. We propose two model-based algorithms inspired by Follow-the-Leader (FTL)
  with prediction: MoBIL-VI based on solving variational inequalities and MoBIL-Prox
  based on stochastic first-order updates. These two methods leverage a model to predict
  future gradients to speed up policy learning. When the model oracle is learned online,
  these algorithms can provably accelerate the best known convergence rate up to an
  order. Our algorithms can be viewed as a generalization of stochastic Mirror-Prox
  (Juditsky et al., 2011), and admit a simple constructive FTL-style analysis of performance.'
