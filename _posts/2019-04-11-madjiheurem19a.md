title: 'Representation Learning on Graphs: A Reinforcement Learning Application'
abstract: In this work, we study value function approximation in reinforcement learning
  (RL) problems with high dimensional  state or action spaces via a generalized version
  of representation policy iteration (RPI). We consider the limitations of proto-value
  functions (PVFs) at accurately approximating the value function in low dimensions
  and we highlight the importance of features learning for an improved low-dimensional
  value function approximation.  Then,  we  adopt different representation learning
  algorithms on graphs to learn the basis functions that best represent the value
  function.  We empirically show that node2vec, an algorithm for scalable feature
  learning in networks, and Graph Auto-Encoder constantly outperform the commonly
  used smooth proto-value functions in low-dimensional feature space.
