title: Autoencoding any Data through Kernel Autoencoders
abstract: 'This paper investigates a novel algorithmic approach to data representation
  based on kernel methods. Assuming that the observations lie in a Hilbert space X
  , the introduced Kernel Autoencoder (KAE) is the composition of mappings from vector-valued
  Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (vv-RKHSs) that minimizes the expected reconstruction
  error. Beyond a first extension of the autoencoding scheme to possibly infinite
  dimensional Hilbert spaces, KAE further allows to autoencode any kind of data by
  choosing X to be itself a RKHS. A theoretical analysis of the model is carried out,
  providing a generalization bound, and shedding light on its connection with Kernel
  Principal Component Analysis. The proposed algorithms are then detailed at length:
  they crucially rely on the form taken by the minimizers, revealed by a dedicated
  Representer Theorem. Finally, numerical experiments on both simulated data and real
  labeled graphs (molecules) provide empirical evidence of the KAE performances.'
