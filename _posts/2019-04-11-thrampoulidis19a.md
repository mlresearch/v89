title: Lifting high-dimensional non-linear models with Gaussian regressors
abstract: We study the problem of recovering a structured signal $\mathbf{x}_0$ from
  high-dimensional data $\mathbf{y}_i=f(\mathbf{a}_i^T\mathbf{x}_0)$ for some nonlinear
  (and potentially unknown) link function $f$, when the regressors $\mathbf{a}_i$
  are iid Gaussian. Brillinger (1982) showed that ordinary least-squares estimates
  $\mathbf{x}_0$ up to a constant of proportionality $\mu_\ell$, which depends on
  $f$. Recently, Plan & Vershynin (2015) extended this result to the high-dimensional
  setting deriving sharp error bounds for the generalized Lasso. Unfortunately, both
  least-squares and the Lasso fail to recover $\mathbf{x}_0$ when  $\mu_\ell=0$. For
  example, this includes all even link functions. We resolve this issue by proposing
  and analyzing an alternative convex recovery method. In a nutshell, our method treats
  such link functions as if they were linear in a lifted space of higher-dimension.
  Interestingly, our error analysis captures the effect of both the nonlinearity and
  the problemâ€™s geometry in a few simple summary parameters.
