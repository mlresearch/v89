title: Adaptive Minimax Regret against Smooth Logarithmic Losses over High-Dimensional
  l1-Balls via Envelope Complexity
abstract: We develop a new theoretical framework, the envelope complexity, to analyze
  the minimax regret with logarithmic loss functions. Within the framework, we derive
  a Bayesian predictor that adaptively achieves the minimax regret over high-dimensional
  l1-balls within a factor of two. The prior is newly derived for achieving the minimax
  regret and called the spike-and-tails (ST) prior as it looks like. The resulting
  regret bound is so simple that it is completely determined with the smoothness of
  the loss function and the radius of the balls except with logarithmic factors, and
  it has a generalized form of existing regret/risk bounds.
