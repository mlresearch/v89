title: Efficient Bayesian Optimization for Target Vector Estimation
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a target vector by querying an unknown
  multi-output function which is stochastic and expensive to evaluate. Through sequential
  experimental design the aim is to minimize the squared Euclidean distance between
  the output of the function and the target vector. Applying standard single-objective
  Bayesian optimization to this problem is both wasteful, since individual output
  components are never observed, and imprecise since the predictive distribution for
  new inputs will be symmetric and have negative support. We address this issue by
  proposing a Gaussian process model that considers the individual function outputs
  and derive a distribution over the resulting 2-norm. Furthermore we derive computationally
  efficient acquisition functions and evaluate the resulting optimization framework
  on several synthetic problems and a real-world problem. The results demonstrate
  a significant improvement over Bayesian optimization based on both standard and
  warped Gaussian processes.
