title: On Theory for BART
abstract: Ensemble learning is a statistical paradigm built on the premise that  many
  weak learners can perform exceptionally well when deployed collectively. The BART
  method of Chipman et al. (2010) is a prominent example of Bayesian ensemble learning,
  where each learner is a tree. Due to its impressive performance, BART has received
  a lot of attention from practitioners. Despite its wide popularity, however, theoretical
  studies of BART have  begun emerging only very recently. Laying down foundation
  for the theoretical analysis of Bayesian forests,  Rockova and van der Pas (2017)
  showed optimal posterior concentration under conditionally uniform tree priors.
  These priors  deviate from the actual priors implemented in BART. Here, we study
  the exact BART prior and propose a simple modification so that  it also enjoys optimality
  properties. To this end, we dive into the branching processes theory. We obtain  tail
  bounds for the distribution of total progeny under heterogeneous Galton-Watson (GW)
  processes using their connection to random walks. We conclude with a result stating  optimal
  rate of convergence for BART.
