title: Online Multiclass Boosting with Bandit Feedback
abstract: We present online boosting algorithms for multiclass classification with
  bandit feedback, where the learner only receives feedback about the correctness
  of its prediction. We propose an unbiased estimate of the loss using a randomized
  prediction, allowing the model to update its weak learners with limited information.
  Using the unbiased estimate, we extend two full information boosting algorithms
  (Jung et al., 2017) to the bandit setting. We prove that the asymptotic error bounds
  of the bandit algorithms exactly match their full information counterparts. The
  cost of restricted feedback is reflected in the larger sample complexity. Experimental
  results also support our theoretical findings, and performance of the proposed models
  is comparable to that of an existing bandit boosting algorithm, which is limited
  to use binary weak learners.
