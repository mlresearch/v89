title: Modularity-based Sparse Soft Graph Clustering
abstract: Clustering is a central problem in machine learning for which graph-based
  approaches have proven their efficiency. In this paper, we study a relaxation of
  the modularity maximization problem, well-known in the graph partitioning literature.
  A solution of this relaxation gives to each element of the dataset a probability
  to belong to a given cluster, whereas a solution of the standard modularity problem
  is a partition. We introduce an efficient optimization algorithm to solve this relaxation,
  that is both memory efficient and local. Furthermore, we prove that our method includes,
  as a special case, the Louvain optimization scheme, a state-of-the-art technique
  to solve the traditional modularity problem. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  data illustrate that our approach provides meaningful information on various types
  of data.
