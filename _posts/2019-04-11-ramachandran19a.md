title: A recurrent Markov state-space generative model for sequences
abstract: While the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a versatile generative model of sequences
  capable of performing many exact inferences efficiently, it is not suited for capturing
  complex long-term structure in the data.  Advanced state-space models based on Deep
  Neural Networks (DNN) overcome this limitation but cannot perform exact inferences.  In
  this article, we present a new generative model for sequences that combines both
  aspects, the ability to perform exact inferences and the ability to model long-term
  structure, by augmenting the HMM with a deterministic, continuous state variable
  modeled through a Recurrent Neural Network. We empirically study the performance
  of the model on (i) synthetic data comparing it to the HMM, (ii) a supervised learning
  task in bioinformatics where it outperforms two DNN-based regressors and (iii) in
  the generative modeling of music where it outperforms many prominent DNN-based generative
  models.
