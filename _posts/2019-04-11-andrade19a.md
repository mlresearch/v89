title: Efficient Bayes Risk Estimation for Cost-Sensitive Classification
abstract: In some real world applications, acquiring covariates for classification
  can be cost-intensive and should be limited as much as possible. For example, in
  the medical setting, a doctor cannot just perform all possible types of tests to
  classify whether the patient has diabetes or not. The decision of classifying or
  acquiring more covariates before classifying is dependent on the costs of new covariates
  and the expected optimal cost of misclassification (Bayes risk). However, estimating
  the latter is a formidable task due to the estimation of a high dimensional probability
  density and intractable integrals. In this work, we show that for linear classifiers
  this task can be considerably simplified, leading to a one dimensional integral
  for which we propose an efficient approximation. Experimental results on three datasets
  show consistent improvements over previously proposed methods for cost-sensitive
  classification. We also demonstrate that our proposed Bayes risk estimation procedure
  can benefit from additional unlabeled data which can be helpful when only small
  amount of labeled data is available.
