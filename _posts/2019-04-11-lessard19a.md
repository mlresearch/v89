title: An Optimal Control Approach to Sequential Machine Teaching
abstract: Given a sequential learning algorithm and a target model, sequential machine
  teaching aims to find the shortest training sequence to drive the learning algorithm
  to the target model. We present the first principled way to find such shortest training
  sequences. Our key insight is to formulate sequential machine teaching as a time-optimal
  control problem. This allows us to solve sequential teaching by leveraging key theoretical
  and computational tools developed over the past 60 years in the optimal control
  community. Specifically, we study the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, which yields
  a necessary condition for opti- mality of a training sequence. We present analytic,
  structural, and numerical implica- tions of this approach on a case study with a
  least-squares loss function and gradient de- scent learner. We compute optimal train-
  ing sequences for this problem, and although the sequences seem circuitous, we find
  that they can vastly outperform the best available heuristics for generating training
  sequences.
