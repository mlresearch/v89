title: Doubly Semi-Implicit Variational Inference
abstract: We extend the existing framework of semi-implicit variational inference
  (SIVI) and introduce doubly semi-implicit variational inference (DSIVI), a way to
  perform variational inference and learning when both the approximate posterior and
  the prior distribution are semi-implicit. In other words, DSIVI performs inference
  in models where the prior and the posterior can be expressed as an intractable infinite
  mixture of some analytic density with a highly flexible implicit mixing distribution.
  We provide a sandwich bound on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective that can
  be made arbitrarily tight. Unlike discriminator-based and kernel-based approaches
  to implicit variational inference, DSIVI optimizes a proper lower bound on ELBO
  that is asymptotically exact. We evaluate DSIVI on a set of problems that benefit
  from implicit priors. In particular, we show that DSIVI gives rise to a simple modification
  of VampPrior, the current state-of-the-art prior for variational autoencoders, which
  improves its performance.
