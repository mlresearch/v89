title: What made you do this? Understanding black-box decisions with sufficient input
  subsets
abstract: Local explanation frameworks aim to rationalize particular decisions made
  by a black-box prediction model.  Existing techniques are often restricted to a
  specific type of predictor or based on input saliency, which may be undesirably
  sensitive to factors unrelated to the model’s decision making process.  We instead
  propose sufficient input subsets that identify minimal subsets of features whose
  observed values alone suffice for the same decision to be reached, even if all other
  input feature values are missing.  General principles that globally govern a model’s
  decision-making can also be revealed by searching for clusters of such input patterns
  across many data points.  Our approach is conceptually straightforward, entirely
  model-agnostic, simply implemented using instance-wise backward selection, and able
  to produce more concise rationales than existing techniques.  We demonstrate the
  utility of our interpretation method on various neural network models trained on
  text, image, and genomic data.
