title: Unbiased Smoothing using Particle Independent Metropolis-Hastings
abstract: We consider the approximation of expectations with respect to the distribution
  of a latent Markov process given noisy measurements. This is known as the smoothing
  problem and is often approached with particle and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  methods. These methods provide consistent but biased estimators when run for a finite
  time. We propose a simple way of coupling two MCMC chains built using Particle Independent
  Metropolis-Hastings (PIMH) to produce unbiased smoothing estimators. Unbiased estimators
  are appealing in the context of parallel computing, and facilitate the construction
  of confidence intervals. The proposed scheme only requires access to off-the-shelf
  Particle Filters (PF) and is thus easier to implement than recently proposed unbiased
  smoothers. The approach is demonstrated on a LÃ©vy-driven stochastic volatility model
  and a stochastic kinetic model.
