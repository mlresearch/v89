title: On the Connection Between Learning Two-Layer Neural Networks and Tensor Decomposition
abstract: We establish connections between the problem of learning a two-layer neural
  network and tensor decomposition. We consider a model with feature vectors $x$,
  $r$ hidden units with weights $w_i$ and output $y$, i.e., $y=\sum_{i=1}^r \sigma(w_i^{T}
  x)$, with activation functions given by low-degree polynomials. In particular, if
  $\sigma(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_3x^3$, we prove that no polynomial-time algorithm can outperform
  the trivial predictor that assigns to  each example the response variable $E(y)$,
  when $d^{3/2}<< r <<d^2$.  Our conclusion holds for a ’natural data distribution’,
  namely standard Gaussian feature vectors $x$, and output distributed according to
  a two-layer neural network with random isotropic weights, and under a certain complexity-theoretic
  assumption on tensor decomposition. Roughly speaking, we assume that no polynomial-time
  algorithm can substantially outperform current methods for tensor decomposition  based
  on the sum-of-squares hierarchy.  We also prove generalizations of this statement
  for higher degree polynomial activations, and non-random weight vectors. Remarkably,
  several existing algorithms for learning two-layer networks with rigorous guarantees
  are based on tensor decomposition. Our results support the idea that this is indeed
  the core computational difficulty in learning such networks, under the stated generative
  model for the data. As a side result, we show that under this model learning the
  network requires accurate learning of its weights, a property that does not hold
  in a more general setting.
