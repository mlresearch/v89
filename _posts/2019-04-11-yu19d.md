title: Parallel Asynchronous Stochastic Coordinate Descent with Auxiliary Variables
abstract: The key to the recent success of coordinate descent (CD) in many applications
  is to maintain a set of auxiliary variables to facilitate efficient single variable
  updates. For example, the vector of residual/primal variables has to be maintained
  when CD is applied for Lasso/linear SVM, respectively. An implementation without
  maintenance is $O(n)$ times slower than the one with maintenance, where n is the
  number of variables. In serial implementations, maintaining auxiliary variables
  is only a computing trick without changing the behavior of coordinate descent. However,
  maintenance of auxiliary variables is non-trivial when there are multiple threads/workers
  which read/write the auxiliary variables concurrently. Thus, most existing theoretical
  analysis of parallel CD either assumes vanilla CD without auxiliary variables (which
  ends up being extremely slow in practice) or limits to a small class of problems.
  In this paper, we consider a rich family of objective functions where AUX-PCD can
  be applied. We also establish global linear convergence for AUX-PCD with atomic
  operations for a general family of functions and perform a complete backward error
  analysis of AUX-PCD with wild updates, where some updates are not just delayed but
  lost because of memory conflicts. Our results enable us to provide theoretical guarantees
  for many practical parallel coordinate descent implementations, which currently
  lack guarantees (such as the implementation of Shotgun by Bradley et al. 2011, which
  uses auxiliary variables)
