title: Imitation-Regularized Offline Learning
abstract: We study the problem of offline learning in automated decision systems under
  the contextual bandits model. We are given logged historical data consisting of
  contexts, (randomized) actions, and (nonnegative) rewards. A common goal is to evaluate
  what would happen if different actions were taken in the same contexts, so as to
  optimize the action policies accordingly. The typical approach to this problem,
  inverse probability weighted estimation (IPWE), requires logged action probabilities,
  which may be missing in practice due to engineering complications. Even when available,
  small action probabilities cause large uncertainty in IPWE, rendering the corresponding
  results insignificant. To solve both problems, we show how one can use policy improvement
  (PIL) objectives, regularized by policy imitation (IML). We motivate and analyze
  PIL as an extension to Clipped-IPWE, by showing that both are lower-bound surrogates
  to the vanilla IPWE. We also formally connect IML to IPWE variance estimation and
  natural policy gradients. Without probability logging, our PIL-IML interpretations
  justify and improve, by reward-weighting, the state-of-art cross-entropy (CE) loss
  that predicts the action items among all action candidates available in the same
  contexts. With probability logging, our main theoretical contribution connects IML-underfitting
  to the existence of either confounding variables or model misspecification. We show
  the value and accuracy of our insights by simulations based on Simpsonâ€™s paradox,
  standard UCI multiclass-to-bandit conversions and on the Criteo counterfactual analysis
  challenge dataset.
