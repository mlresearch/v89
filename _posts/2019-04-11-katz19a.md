title: Size of Interventional Markov Equivalence Classes in random DAG models
abstract: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models are popular for capturing causal relationships.
  From observational and interventional data, a DAG model can only be determined up
  to its \emph{interventional Markov equivalence class} (I-MEC). We investigate the
  size of MECs for random DAG models generated by uniformly sampling and ordering
  an Erdős-Rényi graph. For constant density, we show that the expected $\log$ observational
  MEC  size asymptotically (in the number of vertices) approaches a constant. We characterize
  I-MEC size in a similar fashion in the above settings with high precision. We show
  that the asymptotic expected number of interventions required to fully identify
  a DAG is a constant. These results are obtained by exploiting Meek rules and coupling
  arguments to provide sharp upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic quantities,
  which are then calculated numerically up to high precision. Our results have important
  consequences for experimental design of interventions and the development of algorithms
  for causal inference.
