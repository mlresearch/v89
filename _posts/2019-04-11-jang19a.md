title: Minimum Volume Topic Modeling
abstract: We propose a new topic modeling procedure that takes advantage of the fact
  that the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) log-likelihood function is asymptotically
  equivalent to the logarithm of the volume of the topic simplex. This allows topic
  modeling to be reformulated as finding the probability simplex that minimizes its
  volume and encloses the documents that are represented as distributions over words.
  A convex relaxation of the minimum volume topic model optimization is proposed,
  and it is shown that the relaxed problem has the same global minimum as the original
  problem under the separability assumption and the sufficiently scattered assumption
  introduced by Arora et al. (2013) and Huang et al. (2016). A locally convergent
  alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is introduced for solving
  the relaxed minimum volume problem. Numerical experiments illustrate the benefits
  of our approach in terms of computation time and topic recovery performance.
