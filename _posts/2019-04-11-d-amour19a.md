title: 'On Multi-Cause Approaches to Causal Inference with Unobserved Counfounding:
  Two Cautionary Failure Cases and A Promising Alternative'
abstract: Unobserved confounding is a central barrier to drawing causal inferences
  from observational data. Several authors have recently proposed that this barrier
  can be overcome in the case where one attempts to infer the effects of several variables
  simultaneously.  In this paper, we present two simple, analytical counterexamples
  that challenge the general claims that are central to these approaches. We discuss
  some reasons for these failures and suggest directions for obtaining sufficient
  conditions for causal identifiaciton. Despite these negative results, we show that
  a simple modification to the multi-cause setting, incorporating a proxy or negative
  control variable, solves many of the problems highlighted by the examples, and suggest
  a way forward for causal inference with high-dimensional action spaces.
