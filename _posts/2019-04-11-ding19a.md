title: A Fast Sampling Algorithm for Maximum Inner Product Search
abstract: Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) has been recognized as an important
  operation for the inference phase of many machine learning algorithms, including
  matrix factorization, multi-class/multi-label prediction and neural networks. In
  this paper, we propose Sampling-MIPS, which is the first sampling based algorithm
  that can be applied to the MIPS problem on a set of general vectors with both positive
  and negative values. Our Sampling-MIPS algorithm is efficient in terms of both time
  and sample complexity. In particular, by designing a two-step sampling with alias
  table, Sampling-MIPS only requires constant time to draw a candidate. In addition,
  we show that the probability of candidate generation in our algorithm is consistent
  with the true ranking induced by the value of the corresponding inner products,
  and derive the sample complexity of Sampling-MIPS to obtain the true candidate.
  Furthermore, the algorithm can be easily extended to large problems with sparse
  candidate vectors. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show that
  Sampling-MIPS is consistently better than other previous approaches such as LSH-MIPS,
  PCA-MIPS and Diamond sampling approach.
