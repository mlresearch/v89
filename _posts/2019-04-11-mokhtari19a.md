title: Efficient Nonconvex Empirical Risk Minimization via Adaptive Sample Size Methods
abstract: In this paper, we are interested in finding a local minimizer of an empirical
  risk minimization (ERM) problem where the loss associated with each sample is possibly
  a nonconvex function. Unlike traditional deterministic and stochastic algorithms
  that attempt to solve the ERM problem for the full training set, we propose an adaptive
  sample size scheme to reduce the overall computational complexity of finding a local
  minimum. To be more precise, we first find an approximate local minimum of the ERM
  problem corresponding to a small number of samples and use the uniform convergence
  theory to show that if the population risk is a Morse function, by properly increasing
  the size of training set the iterates generated by the proposed procedure always
  stay close to a local minimum of the corresponding ERM problem. Therefore, eventually,
  the proposed procedure finds a local minimum of the ERM corresponding to the full
  training set which happens to also be close to a local minimum of the expected risk
  minimization problem with high probability. We formally state the conditions on
  the size of the initial sample set and characterize the required accuracy for obtaining
  an approximate local minimum to ensure that the iterates always stay in a neighborhood
  of a local minimum and do not get attracted to saddle points.
