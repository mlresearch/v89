title: On the Interaction Effects Between Prediction and Clustering
abstract: Machine learning systems increasingly depend on pipelines of multiple algorithms
  to provide high quality and well structured predictions. This paper argues interaction
  effects between clustering and prediction (e.g. classification, regression) algorithms
  can cause subtle adverse behaviors during cross-validation that may not be initially
  apparent. In particular, we focus on the problem of estimating the out-of-cluster
  (OOC) prediction loss given an approximate clustering with probabilistic error rate
  p_0. Traditional cross-validation techniques exhibit significant empirical bias
  in this setting, and  the few attempts to estimate and correct for these effects
  are intractable on larger datasets. Further, no previous work has been able to characterize
  the conditions under which these empirical effects occur, and if they do, what properties
  they have. We precisely answer these questions by providing theoretical properties
  which hold in various settings, and prove that expected out-of-cluster loss behavior
  rapidly decays with even minor clustering errors. Fortunately, we are able to leverage
  these same properties to construct hypothesis tests and scalable estimators necessary
  for correcting the problem. Empirical results on benchmark datasets validate our
  theoretical results and demonstrate how scaling techniques provide solutions to
  new classes of problems.
