title: 'Knockoffs for the Mass: New Feature Importance Statistics with False Discovery
  Guarantees'
abstract: An important problem in machine learning and statistics is to identify features
  that causally affect the outcome. This is often impossible to do from purely observational
  data, and a natural relaxation is to identify features that are correlated with
  the outcome even conditioned on all other observed features. For example, we want
  to identify that smoking really is correlated with cancer conditioned on demographics.
  The knockoff procedure is a recent breakthrough in statistics that, in theory, can
  identify truly correlated features while guaranteeing that false discovery rate
  is controlled. The idea is to create synthetic data-knockoffs-that capture correlations
  among the features. However, there are substantial computational and practical challenges
  to generating and using knockoffs. This paper makes several key advances that enable
  knockoff application to be more efficient and powerful. We develop an efficient
  algorithm to generate valid knockoffs from Bayesian Networks. Then we systematically
  evaluate knockoff test statistics and develop new statistics with improved power.
  The paper combines new mathematical guarantees with systematic experiments on real
  and synthetic data.
