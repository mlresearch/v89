title: Sparse Feature Selection in Kernel Discriminant Analysis via Optimal Scoring
abstract: We consider the two-group classification problem and propose a kernel classifier
  based on the optimal scoring framework. Unlike previous approaches, we provide theoretical
  guarantees on the expected risk consistency of the method. We also allow for feature
  selection by imposing structured sparsity using weighted kernels. We propose fully-automated
  methods for selection of all tuning parameters, and in particular adapt kernel shrinkage
  ideas for ridge parameter selection. Numerical studies demonstrate the superior
  classification performance of the proposed approach compared to existing nonparametric
  classifiers.
