title: Reparameterizing Distributions on Lie Groups
abstract: 'Reparameterizable densities are an important way to learn probability distributions
  in a deep learning setting. For many distributions it is possible to create low-variance
  gradient estimators by utilizing a ‘reparameterization trick’. Due to the absence
  of a general reparameterization trick, much research has recently been devoted to
  extend the number of reparameterizable distributional families. Unfortunately, this
  research has primarily focused on distributions defined in Euclidean space, ruling
  out the usage of one of the most influential class of spaces with non-trivial topologies:
  Lie groups. In this work we define a general framework to create reparameterizable
  densities on arbitrary Lie groups, and provide a detailed practitioners guide to
  further the ease of usage. We demonstrate how to create complex and multimodal distributions
  on the well known oriented group of 3D rotations, SO{3}, using normalizing flows.
  Our experiments on applying such distributions in a Bayesian setting for pose estimation
  on objects with discrete and continuous symmetries, showcase their necessity in
  achieving realistic uncertainty estimates.'
