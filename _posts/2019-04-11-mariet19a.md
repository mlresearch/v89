title: Foundations of Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling for Time Series
abstract: The availability of large amounts of time series data, paired with the performance
  of deep-learning algorithms on a broad class of problems, has recently led to significant
  interest in the use of sequence-to-sequence models for time series forecasting.
  We provide the first theoretical analysis of this time series forecasting framework.
  We include a comparison of sequence-to-sequence modeling to classical time series
  models, and as such  our theory can serve as a quantitative guide for practitioners
  choosing between different modeling methodologies.
