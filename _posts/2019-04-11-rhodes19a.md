title: Variational Noise-Contrastive Estimation
abstract: Unnormalised latent variable models are a broad and flexible class of statistical
  models. However, learning their parameters from data is intractable, and few estimation
  techniques are currently available for such models. To increase the number of techniques
  in our arsenal, we propose variational noise-contrastive estimation (VNCE), building
  on NCE which is a method that only applies to unnormalised models. The core idea
  is to use a variational lower bound to the NCE objective function, which can be
  optimised in the same fashion as the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in standard variational
  inference (VI). We prove that VNCE can be used for both parameter estimation of
  unnormalised models and posterior inference of latent variables. The developed theory
  shows that VNCE has the same level of generality as standard VI, meaning that advances
  made there can be directly imported to the unnormalised setting. We validate VNCE
  on toy models and apply it to a realistic problem of estimating an undirected graphical
  model from incomplete data.
