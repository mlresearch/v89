title: A Robust Zero-Sum Game Framework for Pool-based Active Learning
abstract: In this paper, we present a novel robust zero- sum game framework for pool-based
  active learning grounded on advanced statistical learning theory. Pool-based active
  learning usually consists of two components, namely, learning of a classifier given
  labeled data and querying of unlabeled data for labeling. Most previous studies
  on active learning consider these as two separate tasks and propose various heuristics
  for selecting important unlabeled data for labeling, which may render the selection
  of unlabeled examples sub-optimal for minimizing the classification error. In contrast,
  the present work formulates active learning as a unified optimization framework
  for learning the classifier, i.e., the querying of labels and the learning of models
  are unified to minimize a common objective for statistical learning. In addition,
  the proposed method avoids the issues of many previous algorithms such as inefficiency,
  sampling bias and sensitivity to imbalanced data distribution. Besides theoretical
  analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and demonstrate
  the superior performance of the proposed active learning method compared with the
  state-of-the-art methods.
