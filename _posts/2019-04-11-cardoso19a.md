title: Risk-Averse Stochastic Convex Bandit
abstract: Motivated by applications in clinical trials and finance, we study the problem
  of online convex optimization (with bandit feedback) where the decision maker is
  risk-averse. We provide two algorithms to solve this problem. The first one is a
  descent-type algorithm which is easy to implement. The second algorithm, which combines
  the ellipsoid method and a center point device, achieves (almost) optimal regret
  bounds with respect to the number of rounds. To the best of our knowledge this is
  the first attempt to address risk-aversion in the online convex bandit problem.
