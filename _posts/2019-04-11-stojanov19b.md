title: Data-Driven Approach to Multiple-Source Domain Adaptation
abstract: A key problem in domain adaptation is determining what to transfer across
  different domains. We propose a data-driven method to represent these changes across
  multiple source domains and perform unsupervised domain adaptation. We assume that
  the joint distributions follow a specific generating process and have a small number
  of identifiable changing parameters, and develop a data-driven method to identify
  the changing parameters by learning low-dimensional representations of the changing
  class-conditional distributions across multiple source domains. The learned low-dimensional
  representations enable us to reconstruct the target-domain joint distribution from
  unlabeled target-domain data, and further enable predicting the labels in the target
  domain. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method by conducting experiments on
  synthetic and real datasets.
