title: Probabilistic Multilevel Clustering via Composite Transportation Distance
abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic approach to multilevel clustering problems
  based on composite transportation distance, which is a variant of transportation
  distance where the underlying metric is Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our method
  involves solving a joint optimization problem over spaces of probability measures
  to simultaneously discover grouping structures within groups and among groups. By
  exploiting the connection of our method to the problem of finding composite transportation
  barycenters, we develop fast and efficient optimization algorithms even for potentially
  large-scale multilevel datasets. Finally, we present experimental results with both
  synthetic and real data to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed
  approach.
