title: Identifiability of Generalized Hypergeometric Distribution (GHD) Directed Acyclic
  Graphical Models
abstract: We introduce a new class of identifiable DAG models where the conditional
  distribution of each node given its parents belongs to a family of generalized hypergeometric
  distributions (GHD). A family of generalized hypergeometric distributions includes
  a lot of discrete distributions such as the binomial, Beta-binomial, negative binomial,
  Poisson, hyper-Poisson, and many more. We prove that if the data drawn from the
  new class of DAG models, one can fully identify the graph structure. We further
  present a reliable and polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the graph from finitely
  many data. We show through theoretical results and numerical experiments that our
  algorithm is statistically consistent in high-dimensional settings (p >n) if the
  indegree of the graph is bounded, and out-performs state-of-the-art DAG learning
  algorithms.
