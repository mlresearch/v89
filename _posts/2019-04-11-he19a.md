title: 'XBART: Accelerated Bayesian Additive Regression Trees'
abstract: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) (Chipman et. al., 2010) is a powerful
  predictive model that often outperforms alternative models at out-of-sample prediction.
  BART is especially well-suited to settings with unstructured predictor variables
  and substantial sources of unmeasured variation as is typical in the social, behavioral
  and health sciences. This paper develops a modified version of BART that is amenable
  to fast posterior estimation. We present a stochastic hill climbing algorithm that
  matches the remarkable predictive accuracy of previous BART implementations, but
  is many times faster and less memory intensive.  Simulation studies show that the
  new method is comparable in computation time and more accurate at function estimation
  than both random forests and gradient boosting.
