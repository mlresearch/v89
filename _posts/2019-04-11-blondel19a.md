title: 'Learning Classifiers with Fenchel-Young Losses: Generalized Entropies, Margins,
  and Algorithms'
abstract: This paper studies Fenchel-Young losses, a generic way to construct convex
  loss functions from a regularization function.  We analyze their properties in depth,
  showing that they unify many well-known loss functions and allow to create useful
  new ones easily.  Fenchel-Young losses constructed from a generalized entropy, including
  the Shannon and Tsallis entropies, induce predictive probability distributions.  We
  formulate conditions for a generalized entropy to yield losses with a separation
  margin, and probability distributions with sparse support.  Finally, we derive efficient
  algorithms, making Fenchel-Young losses appealing both in theory and practice.
