title: Sparse Multivariate  Bernoulli Processes in High Dimensions
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a multivariate Bernoulli
  process with auto-regressive feedback in the high-dimensional setting where the
  number of samples available is much less than the number of parameters. This problem
  arises in learning interconnections of networks of dynamical systems with spiking
  or binary valued data.  We also allow the process to depend on its past up to a
  lag p, for a general $p \geq 1$, allowing for more realistic modeling in many applications.
  We propose and analyze an $\ell_1$-regularized maximum likelihood (ML) estimator
  under the assumption that the parameter tensor is approximately sparse. Rigorous
  analysis of such estimators is made challenging by the dependent and non-Gaussian
  nature of the process as well as the presence of the nonlinearities and multi-level
  feedback. We derive precise upper bounds on the mean-squared estimation error in
  terms of the number of samples, dimensions of the process, the lag $p$ and other
  key statistical properties of the model. The ideas presented can be used in the
  rigorous high-dimensional analysis of regularized $M$-estimators for other sparse
  nonlinear and non-Gaussian processes with long-range dependence.
