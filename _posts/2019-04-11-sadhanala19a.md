title: A Higher-Order Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test
abstract: We present an extension of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) two-sample test,
  which can be more sensitive to differences in the tails.  Our test statistic is
  an integral probability metric (IPM) defined over a higher-order total variation
  ball, recovering the original KS test as its simplest case.  We give an exact representer
  result for our IPM, which generalizes the fact that the original KS test statistic
  can be expressed in equivalent variational and CDF forms.  For small enough orders
  $(k \le 5)$, we develop a linear-time algorithm for computing our higher-order KS
  test statistic; for all others $(k \ge 6)$, we give a nearly linear-time approximation.  We
  derive the asymptotic null distribution for our test, and show that our nearly linear-time
  approximation shares the same asymptotic null.  Lastly, we complement our theory
  with numerical studies.
