title: Analysis of Network Lasso for Semi-Supervised Regression
abstract: "We apply network Lasso to semi-supervised regression problems involving
  network-structured data. This approach lends quite naturally to highly scalable
  learning algorithms in the form of message passing over an empirical graph which
  represents the network structure of the data. By using a simple non-parametric regression
  model, which is motivated by a clustering hypothesis, we provide an analysis of
  the estimation error incurred by network Lasso. This analysis reveals conditions
  on the network structure and the available training data which guarantee network
  Lasso to be accurate. Remarkably, the accuracy of network Lasso is related to the
  existence of sufficiently large network flows over the empirical graph. Thus, our
  analysis reveals a connection between network Lasso and maximum network flow problems."
