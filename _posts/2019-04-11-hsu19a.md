title: Bayesian Learning of Conditional Kernel Mean Embeddings for Automatic Likelihood-Free
  Inference
abstract: In likelihood-free settings where likelihood evaluations are intractable,
  approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) addresses the formidable inference task to
  discover plausible parameters of simulation programs that explain the observations.
  However, they demand large quantities of simulation calls. Critically, hyperparameters
  that determine measures of simulation discrepancy crucially balance inference accuracy
  and sample efficiency, yet are difficult to tune. In this paper, we present kernel
  embedding likelihood-free inference (KELFI), a holistic framework that automatically
  learns model hyperparameters to improve inference accuracy given limited simulation
  budget. By leveraging likelihood smoothness with conditional mean embeddings, we
  nonparametrically approximate likelihoods and posteriors as surrogate densities
  and sample from closed-form posterior mean embeddings, whose hyperparameters are
  learned under its approximate marginal likelihood. Our modular framework demonstrates
  improved accuracy and efficiency on challenging inference problems in ecology.
