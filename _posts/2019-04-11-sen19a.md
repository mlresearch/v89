title: 'Noisy Blackbox Optimization using Multi-fidelity Queries: A Tree Search Approach'
abstract: We study the problem of black-box optimization of a noisy function in the
  presence of low-cost approximations or fidelities, which is motivated by problems
  like hyper-parameter tuning. In hyper-parameter tuning evaluating the black-box
  function at a point involves training a learning algorithm on a large data-set at
  a particular hyper-parameter and evaluating the validation error. Even a single
  such evaluation can be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, it is beneficial to use
  low-cost approximations, like training the learning algorithm on a sub-sampled version
  of the whole data-set. These low-cost approximations/fidelities can however provide
  a biased and noisy estimate of the function value. In this work, we combine structured
  state-space exploration through hierarchical partitioning with querying these partitions
  at multiple fidelities, and develop a multi-fidelity bandit based tree-search algorithm
  for noisy black-box optimization. We derive simple regret guarantees for our algorithm
  and validate its performance on real and synthetic datasets.
