title: Estimation of Non-Normalized Mixture Models
abstract: We develop a general method for estimating a finite mixture of non-normalized
  models. A non-normalized model is defined to be a parametric distribution with an
  intractable normalization constant. Existing methods for estimating non-normalized
  models without computing the normalization constant are not applicable to mixture
  models because they contain more than one intractable normalization constant. The
  proposed method is derived by extending noise contrastive estimation (NCE), which
  estimates non-normalized models by discriminating between the observed data and
  some artificially generated noise. In particular, the proposed method provides a
  probabilistically principled clustering method that is able to utilize a deep representation.
  Applications to clustering of natural images and neuroimaging data give promising
  results.
