title: 'Local Saddle Point Optimization: A Curvature Exploitation Approach'
abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods are the most popular choice for finding
  local optima for classical minimization and saddle point problems. Here, we highlight
  a systemic issue of gradient dynamics that arise for saddle point problems, namely
  the presence of undesired stable stationary points that are no local optima. We
  propose a novel optimization approach that exploits curvature information in order
  to escape from these undesired stationary points. We prove that different optimization
  methods, including gradient method and Adagrad, equipped with curvature exploitation
  can escape non-optimal stationary points. We also provide empirical results on common
  saddle point problems which confirm the advantage of using curvature exploitation.
