title: Statistical Optimal Transport via Factored Couplings
abstract: We propose a new method to estimate Wasserstein distances and optimal transport
  plans between two probability distributions from samples in high dimension. Unlike
  plug-in rules that simply replace the true distributions by their empirical counterparts,
  our method promotes couplings with low transport rank, a new structural assumption
  that is similar to the nonnegative rank of a matrix. Regularizing based on this
  assumption leads to drastic improvements on high-dimensional data for various tasks,
  including domain adaptation in single-cell RNA sequencing data. These findings are
  supported by a theoretical analysis that indicates that the transport rank is key
  in overcoming the curse of dimensionality inherent to data-driven optimal transport.
