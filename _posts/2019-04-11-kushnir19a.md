title: Towards Clustering High-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Clouds in Linear Running
  Time
abstract: Clustering mixtures of Gaussian distributions is a fundamental and challenging
  problem. State-of-the-art theoretical work on learning Gaussian mixture models has
  mostly focused on estimating the mixture parameters, where clustering is given as
  a byproduct. These methods have focused mostly on improving separation bounds for
  different mixture classes, and doing so in polynomial time and sample complexity.
  Less emphasis has been given to aligning these algorithms to the challenges of big
  data. In this paper, we focus on clustering $n$ samples from an arbitrary mixture
  of $c$-separated Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^p$ in time that is linear in $p$ and $n$,
  and  sample complexity that is independent of $p$. Our analysis suggests that for
  sufficiently separated Gaussians after $o(\log{p})$ random projections a good direction
  is found that yields a small clustering error. Specifically, for a user-specified
  error $e$, the expected number of such projections is small and bounded by $o(\ln
  p)$ when $\gamma\leq c\sqrt{\ln{\ln{p}}}$ and $\gamma=Q^{-1}(e)$ is the separation
  of the Gaussians with $Q$ as the tail distribution function of the normal distribution.  Consequently,
  the  expected overall running time of the algorithm is linear in $n$ and quasi-linear
  in $p$ at $o(\ln{p})O(np)$, and the sample complexity is independent of $p$. Unlike
  the methods that are based on $k$-means, our analysis is applicable to any mixture
  class (spherical or non-spherical). Finally, an extension to $k>2$ components is
  also provided.
