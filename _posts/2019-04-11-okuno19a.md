title: Graph Embedding with Shifted Inner Product Similarity and Its Improved Approximation
  Capability
abstract: We propose shifted inner-product similarity (SIPS), which is a novel yet
  very simple extension of the ordinary inner-product similarity (IPS) for neural-network
  based graph embedding (GE). In contrast to IPS, that is limited to approximating
  positive-definite (PD) similarities, SIPS goes beyond the limitation by introducing
  bias terms in IPS; we theoretically prove that SIPS is capable of approximating
  not only PD but also conditionally PD (CPD) similarities with many examples such
  as cosine similarity, negative Poincare distance and negative Wasserstein distance.
  Since SIPS with sufficiently large neural networks learns a variety of similarities,  SIPS
  alleviates the need for configuring the similarity function of GE. Approximation
  error rate is also evaluated, and experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate
  that graph embedding using SIPS indeed outperforms existing methods.
