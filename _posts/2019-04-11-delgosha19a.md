title: Deep Switch Networks for Generating Discrete Data and Language
abstract: Multilayer switch networks are proposed as artificial generators of high-dimensional
  discrete data (e.g., binary vectors, categorical data, natural language, network
  log files, and discrete-valued time series). Unlike deconvolution networks which
  generate continuous-valued data and which consist of upsampling filters and reverse
  pooling layers, multilayer switch networks are composed of adaptive switches which
  model conditional distributions of discrete random variables. An interpretable,
  statistical framework is introduced for training these nonlinear networks based
  on a maximum-likelihood objective function. To learn network parameters, stochastic
  gradient descent is applied to the objective, and is stable until convergence. This
  direct optimization does not involve back-propagation over separate encoder and
  decoder networks, or adversarial training of dueling networks. While training remains
  tractable for moderately sized networks, Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximations
  of gradients are derived for deep networks which contain latent variables. The statistical
  framework is evaluated on synthetic data, high-dimensional binary data of handwritten
  digits, and web-crawled natural language data. Aspects of the modelâ€™s framework
  such as interpretability, computational complexity, and generalization ability are
  discussed.
