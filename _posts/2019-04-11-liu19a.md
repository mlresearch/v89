title: Distributed Inexact Newton-type Pursuit for Non-convex Sparse Learning
abstract: In this paper, we present a sample distributed greedy pursuit method for
  non-convex sparse learning under cardinality constraint. Given the training samples
  uniformly randomly partitioned across multiple machines, the proposed method alternates
  between local inexact sparse minimization of a Newton-type approximation and centralized
  global results aggregation. Theoretical analysis shows that for a general class
  of convex functions with Lipschitze continues Hessian, the method converges linearly
  with contraction factor scaling inversely to the local data size; whilst the communication
  complexity required to reach desirable statistical accuracy scales logarithmically
  with respect to the number of machines for some popular statistical learning models.
  For nonconvex objective functions, up to a local estimation error, our method can
  be shown to converge to a local stationary sparse solution with sub-linear communication
  complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method
  when applied to large-scale sparse learning tasks including deep neural nets pruning
