title: Logarithmic Regret for Online Gradient Descent Beyond Strong Convexity
abstract: Hoffman’s classical result gives a bound on the distance of a point from
  a convex and compact polytope in terms of the magnitude of violation of the constraints.
  Recently, several results showed that Hoffman’s bound can be used to derive strongly-convex-like
  rates for first-order methods for \textit{offline} convex optimization of curved,
  though not strongly convex, functions, over polyhedral sets. In this work, we use
  this classical result for the first time to obtain faster rates for \textit{online
  convex optimization} over polyhedral sets with curved convex, though not strongly
  convex, loss functions. We show that under several reasonable assumptions on the
  data, the standard \textit{Online Gradient Descent} algorithm guarantees logarithmic
  regret. To the best of our knowledge, the only previous algorithm to achieve logarithmic
  regret in the considered settings is the \textit{Online Newton Step} algorithm which
  requires quadratic (in the dimension) memory and at least quadratic runtime per
  iteration, which greatly limits its applicability to large-scale problems. In particular,
  our results hold for  \textit{semi-adversarial} settings in which the data is a
  combination of  an arbitrary  (adversarial) sequence and a stochastic sequence,
  which might provide reasonable approximation for many real-world sequences, or under
  a natural assumption that the data is low-rank. We demonstrate via experiments that
  the regret of OGD is indeed comparable to that of ONS (and even far better)  on
  curved though not strongly-convex losses.
