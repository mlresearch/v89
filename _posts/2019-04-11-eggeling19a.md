title: On Structure Priors for Learning Bayesian Networks
abstract: To learn a Bayesian network structure from data, one popular approach is
  to maximize a decomposable likelihood-based score. While various scores have been
  proposed, they usually assume a uniform prior, or “penalty,” over the possible directed
  acyclic graphs (DAGs); relatively little attention has been paid to alternative
  priors. We investigate empirically several structure priors in combination with
  different scores, using benchmark data sets and data sets generated from benchmark
  networks. Our results suggest that, in practice, priors that strongly favor sparsity
  perform significantly better than the uniform prior or even the informed variant
  that is conditioned on the correct number of parents for each node. For an analytic
  comparison of different priors, we generalize a known recurrence equation for the
  number of DAGs to accommodate modular weightings of DAGs, a result that is also
  of independent interest.
