title: Partial Optimality of  Dual Decomposition for MAP Inference in Pairwise MRFs
abstract: Markov random fields (MRFs) are a powerful tool for modelling statistical
  dependencies for a set of random variables using a graphical representation. An
  important computational problem related to MRFs, called maximum a posteriori (MAP)
  inference, is finding a joint variable assignment with the maximal probability.
  It is well known that the two popular optimisation techniques for this task, linear
  programming (LP) relaxation and dual decomposition (DD), have a strong connection
  both providing an optimal solution to the MAP problem  when a corresponding LP relaxation
  is tight. However, less is known about their relationship in the opposite and more
  realistic case. In this paper, we explain how the fully integral assignments obtained
  via DD partially agree with the optimal fractional assignments via LP relaxation
  when the latter is not tight. In particular, for binary pairwise MRFs the corresponding
  result suggests that both methods share the partial optimality property of their
  solutions.
