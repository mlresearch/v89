title: Accelerated Coordinate Descent with Arbitrary Sampling and Best Rates for Minibatches
abstract: Accelerated coordinate descent is a widely popular optimization algorithm
  due to its efficiency on large-dimensional problems. It achieves state-of-the-art
  complexity on an important class of empirical risk minimization problems.  In this
  paper we design and analyze an accelerated coordinate descent (\texttt{ACD}) method
  which in each iteration updates a random subset of coordinates according to an arbitrary
  but fixed probability law, which is a parameter of the method.   While mini-batch
  variants of \texttt{ACD} are more popular and relevant in practice, there is no
  importance sampling for \texttt{ACD} that outperforms the standard uniform mini-batch
  sampling. Through insights enabled by our general analysis, we design new importance
  sampling for mini-batch \texttt{ACD} which significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
  minibatch \texttt{ACD} in practice. We prove a rate that is at most $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\tau})$
  times worse than the rate of minibatch \texttt{ACD} with uniform sampling, but can
  be $\mathcal{O}(n/\tau)$ times better, where $\tau$ is the minibatch size. Since
  in modern supervised learning training systems it is standard practice to choose
  $\tau \ll n$, and often $\tau=\mathcal{O}(1)$, our method can lead to dramatic speedups.
  Lastly, we obtain similar results for minibatch nonaccelerated  \texttt{CD} as well,
  achieving improvements on previous best rates.
