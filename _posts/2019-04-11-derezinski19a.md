title: Correcting the bias in least squares regression with volume-rescaled sampling
abstract: Consider linear regression where the examples are generated by an unknown
  distribution on R^d x R. Without any assumptions on the noise, the linear least
  squares solution for any i.i.d. sample will typically be biased w.r.t. the least
  squares optimum over the entire distribution. However, we show that if an i.i.d.
  sample of any size k is augmented by a certain small additional sample, then the
  solution of the combined sample becomes unbiased. We show this when the additional
  sample consists of d points drawn jointly according to the input distribution rescaled
  by the squared volume spanned by the points. Furthermore, we propose algorithms
  to sample from this volume-rescaled distribution when the data distribution is only
  known through an i.i.d sample.
