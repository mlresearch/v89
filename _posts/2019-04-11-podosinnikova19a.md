title: Overcomplete Independent Component Analysis via SDP
abstract: 'We present a novel algorithm for overcomplete independent components analysis
  (ICA), where the number of latent sources k exceeds the dimension p of observed
  variables. Previous algorithms either suffer from high computational complexity
  or make strong assumptions about the form of the mixing matrix. Our algorithm does
  not make any sparsity assumption yet enjoys favorable computational and theoretical
  properties. Our algorithm consists of two main steps: (a) estimation of the Hessians
  of the cumulant generating function (as opposed to the fourth and higher order cumulants
  used by most algorithms) and (b) a novel semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation
  for recovering a mixing component. We show that this relaxation can be efficiently
  solved with a projected accelerated gradient descent method, which makes the whole
  algorithm computationally practical. Moreover, we conjecture that the proposed program
  recovers a mixing component at the rate $k < p^2/4$ and prove that a mixing component
  can be recovered with high probability when $k <(2 - \epsilon)p\log p$ when the
  original components are sampled uniformly at random on the hyper sphere. Experiments
  are provided on synthetic data and the CIFAR-10 dataset of real images.'
