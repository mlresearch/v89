title: 'Best of many worlds: Robust model selection for online supervised learning'
abstract: We introduce algorithms for online, full-information prediction that   are
  computationally efficient and competitive with contextual tree experts of unknown
  complexity, in both probabilistic and adversarial settings.   We incorporate a novel
  probabilistic framework of structural risk minimization into existing adaptive algorithms
  and show that we can robustly learn not only the presence of stochastic structure
  when it exists, but also the correct model order. When the stochastic data is actually
  realized from a predictor in the model class considered, we obtain regret bounds
  that are competitive with the regret of an optimal algorithm that possesses strong
  side information about both the true model order and whether the process generating
  the data is stochastic or adversarial. In cases where the data does not arise from
  any of the models, our algorithm selects models of higher order as we play more
  rounds.   We display empirically improved \textit{overall prediction error} over
  other adversarially robust approaches.
