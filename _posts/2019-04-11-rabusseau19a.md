title: Connecting Weighted Automata and Recurrent Neural Networks through Spectral
  Learning
abstract: 'In this paper, we unravel a fundamental connection between weighted finite
  automata (WFAs) and second-order recurrent neural networks (2-RNNs): in the case
  of sequences of discrete symbols, WFAs and 2-RNNs with linear activation functions
  are expressively equivalent. Motivated by this result, we build upon a recent extension
  of the spectral learning algorithm to vector-valued WFAs and propose the first provable
  learning algorithm for linear 2-RNNs defined over sequences of continuous input
  vectors. This algorithm relies on estimating low rank sub-blocks of the so-called
  Hankel tensor, from which the parameters of a linear 2-RNN can be provably recovered.
  The performances of the proposed method are assessed in a simulation study.'
