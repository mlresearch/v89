title: A maximum-mean-discrepancy goodness-of-fit test for censored data
abstract: 'We introduce a kernel-based goodness-of-fit test for censored data, where
  observations may be missing in random time intervals: a common occurrence in clinical
  trials and industrial life-testing. The test statistic is straightforward to compute,
  as is the test threshold, and we establish consistency under the null. Unlike earlier
  approaches such as the Log-rank test, we make no assumptions as to how the data
  distribution might differ from the null, and our test has power against a very rich
  class of alternatives. In experiments, our test outperforms competing approaches
  for periodic and Weibull hazard functions (where risks are time dependent), and
  does not show the failure modes of tests that rely on user defined features. Moreover,
  in cases where classical tests are provably most powerful, our test performs almost
  as well, while being more general.'
