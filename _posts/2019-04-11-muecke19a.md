title: Reducing training time by efficient localized kernel regression
abstract: We study generalization properties of kernel regularized least squares regression
  based on a partitioning approach. We show that  optimal rates of convergence are
  preserved  if the number of local sets grows sufficiently slowly with the sample
  size.  Moreover, the partitioning approach can be efficiently combined with local
  Nyström subsampling, improving computational cost twofold.
