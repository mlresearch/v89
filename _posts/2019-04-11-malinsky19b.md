title: A Potential Outcomes Calculus for Identifying Conditional Path-Specific Effects
abstract: The do-calculus is a well-known deductive system for deriving connections
  between interventional and observed distributions, and has been proven complete
  for a number of important identifiability problems in causal inference. Nevertheless,
  as it is currently defined, the do-calculus is inapplicable to causal problems that
  involve complex nested counterfactuals which cannot be expressed in terms of the
  "do" operator. Such problems include analyses of path-specific effects and dynamic
  treatment regimes. In this paper we present the potential outcome calculus (po-calculus),
  a natural generalization of do-calculus for arbitrary potential outcomes. We thereby
  provide a bridge between identification approaches which have their origins in artificial
  intelligence and statistics, respectively. We use po-calculus to give a complete
  identification algorithm for conditional path-specific effects with applications
  to problems in mediation analysis and algorithmic fairness.
