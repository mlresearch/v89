title: Training Variational Autoencoders with Buffered Stochastic Variational Inference
abstract: The recognition network in deep latent variable models such as variational
  autoencoders (VAEs) relies on amortized inference for efficient posterior approximation
  that can scale up to large datasets. However, this technique has also been demonstrated
  to select suboptimal variational parameters, often resulting in considerable additional
  error called the amortization gap. To close the amortization gap and improve the
  training of the generative model, recent works have introduced an additional refinement
  step that applies stochastic variational inference (SVI) to improve upon the variational
  parameters returned by the amortized inference model. In this paper, we propose
  the Buffered Stochastic Variational Inference (BSVI), a new refinement procedure
  that makes use of SVIâ€™s sequence of intermediate variational proposal distributions
  and their corresponding importance weights to construct a new generalized importance-weighted
  lower bound. We demonstrate empirically that training the variational autoencoders
  with BSVI consistently out-performs SVI, yielding an improved training procedure
  for VAEs.
