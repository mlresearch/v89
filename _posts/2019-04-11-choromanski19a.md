title: 'KAMA-NNs: Low-dimensional Rotation Based Neural Networks'
abstract: We present new architectures for feedforward neural networks built from
  products of learned or random low-dimensional rotations that offer substantial space
  compression and computational speedups in comparison to the unstructured baselines.
  Models using them are also competitive with the baselines and often, due to imposed
  orthogonal structure, outperform baselines accuracy-wise. We propose to use our
  architectures in two settings. We show that in the non-adaptive scenario (random
  neural networks) they lead to asymptotically more accurate, space-efficient and
  faster estimators of the so-called PNG-kernels (for any activation function defining
  the PNG). This generalizes several recent theoretical results about orthogonal estimators
  (e.g. orthogonal JLTs, orthogonal estimators of angular kernels and more). In the
  adaptive setting we propose efficient algorithms for learning products of low-dimensional
  rotations and show how our architectures can be used to improve space and time complexity
  of state of the art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms (e.g. PPO, TRPO). Here
  they offer up to 7x compression of the network in comparison to the unstructured
  baselines and outperform reward-wise state of the art structured neural networks
  offering similar computational gains and based on low displacement rank matrices.
