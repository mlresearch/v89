title: Interpreting Black Box Predictions using Fisher Kernels
abstract: 'Research in both machine learning and psychology suggests that salient
  examples can help humans to interpret learning models. To this end, we take a novel
  look at black box interpretation of test predictions in terms of training examples.
  Our goal is to ask “which training examples are most responsible for a given set
  of predictions”? To answer this question, we make use of Fisher kernels as the defining
  feature embedding of each data point, combined with Sequential Bayesian Quadrature
  (SBQ) for efficient selection of examples. In contrast to prior work, our method
  is able to seamlessly handle any sized subset of test predictions in a principled
  way. We theoretically analyze our approach, providing novel convergence bounds for
  SBQ over discrete candidate atoms. Our approach recovers the application of influence
  functions for interpretability as a special case yielding novel insights from this
  connection. We also present applications of the proposed approach to three use cases:
  cleaning training data, fixing mislabeled examples and data summarization.'
