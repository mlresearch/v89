title: High Dimensional Inference in Partially Linear Models
abstract: We propose two semiparametric versions of the debiased Lasso procedure for
  the model $Y_{i}=X_{i}\beta_{0}+g_{0}(Z_{i})+\varepsilon_{i}$, where the parameter
  vector of interest $\beta_{0}$ is high dimensional but sparse (exactly or approximately)
  and $g_{0}$ is an unknown nuisance function. Both versions are shown to have the
  same asymptotic normal distribution and do not require the minimal signal condition
  for statistical inference of any component in $\beta_{0}$. We further develop a
  simultaneous hypothesis testing procedure based on multiplier bootstrap. Our testing
  method takes into account of the dependence structure within the debiased estimates,
  and allows the number of tested components to be exponentially high.
