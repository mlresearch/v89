title: Towards Understanding the Generalization Bias of Two Layer Convolutional Linear
  Classifiers with Gradient Descent
abstract: A major challenge in understanding the generalization of deep learning is
  to explain why (stochastic) gradient descent can exploit the network architecture
  to find solutions that have good generalization performance when using high capacity
  models. We find simple but realistic examples showing that this phenomenon exists
  even when learning linear classifiers â€” between two linear networks with the same
  capacity, the one with a convolutional layer can generalize better than the other
  when the data distribution has some underlying spatial structure. We argue that
  this difference results from a combination of the convolution architecture, data
  distribution and gradient descent, all of which are necessary to be included in
  a meaningful analysis. We analyze of the generalization performance as a function
  of data distribution and convolutional filter size, given gradient descent as the
  optimization algorithm, then interpret the results using concrete examples. Experimental
  results show that our analysis is able to explain what happens in our introduced
  examples.
