title: Learning Influence-Receptivity Network Structure with Guarantee
abstract: 'Traditional works on community detection from observations of information
  cascade assume that a single adjacency matrix parametrizes all the observed cascades.  However,
  in reality the connection structure usually does not stay the same across cascades.  For
  example, different people have different topics of interest, therefore the connection
  structure depends on the information/topic content of the cascade.  In this paper
  we consider the case where we observe a sequence of noisy adjacency matrices triggered
  by information/events with different topic distributions.  We propose a novel latent
  model using the intuition that a connection is more likely to exist between two
  nodes if they are interested in similar topics, which are common with the information/event.  Specifically,
  we endow each node with two node-topic vectors: an influence vector that measures
  how influential/authoritative they are on each topic; and a receptivity vector that
  measures how receptive/susceptible they are to each topic.  We show how these two
  node-topic structures can be estimated from observed adjacency matrices with theoretical
  guarantee on estimation error, in cases where the topic distributions of the information/events
  are known, as well as when they are unknown. Experiments on synthetic and real data
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and superior performance compared to
  state-of-the-art methods.'
