title: Learning Determinantal Point Processes by Corrective Negative Sampling
abstract: Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) have attracted significant interest
  from  the machine-learning community due to their ability to elegantly and tractably
  model the delicate balance between quality and diversity of sets.  DPPs are  commonly
  learned from data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).  While  fitting observed
  sets well, MLE for DPPs may also assign high likelihoods to unobserved sets that
  are far from the true generative distribution of the  data. To address this issue,
  which reduces the quality of the learned model,  we introduce a novel optimization
  problem, Contrastive Estimation (CE), which encodes information about "negative"
  samples into the basic learning  model. CE is grounded in the successful use of
  negative information in  machine-vision and language modeling. Depending on the
  chosen negative distribution (which may be static or evolve during optimization),
  CE assumes two different forms, which we analyze theoretically and experimentally.
  We  evaluate our new model on real-world datasets; on a challenging dataset, CE
  learning delivers a considerable improvement in predictive performance over a DPP
  learned without using contrastive information.
