title: Adversarial Learning of a Sampler Based on an Unnormalized Distribution
abstract: Fundamental aspects of adversarial learning are investigated, with learning
  based on samples from the target distribution (conventional GAN setup). With insights
  so garnered, adversarial learning is extended to the case for which one has access
  to an unnormalized form $u(x)$ of the target density function, but no samples. Further,
  new concepts in GAN regularization are developed, based on learning from samples
  or from $u(x)$. The proposed method is compared to alternative approaches, with
  encouraging results demonstrated across a range of applications, including deep
  soft Q-learning.
