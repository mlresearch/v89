title: 'Uncertainty Autoencoders: Learning Compressed Representations via Variational
  Information Maximization'
abstract: Compressed sensing techniques enable efficient acquisition and recovery
  of sparse, highdimensional data signals via low-dimensional projections. In this
  work, we propose Uncertainty Autoencoders, a learning framework for unsupervised
  representation learning inspired by compressed sensing. We treat the low-dimensional
  projections as noisy latent representations of an autoencoder and directly learn
  both the acquisition (i.e., encoding) and amortized recovery (i.e., decoding) procedures.
  Our learning objective optimizes for a tractable variational lower bound to the
  mutual information between the datapoints and the latent representations. We show
  how our framework provides a unified treatment to several lines of research in dimensionality
  reduction, compressed sensing, and generative modeling. Empirically, we demonstrate
  a 32% improvement on average over competing approaches for the task of statistical
  compressed sensing of high-dimensional datasets.
