title: A Unified Weight Learning Paradigm for Multi-view Learning
abstract: Learning a set of weights to combine views linearly forms a series of popular
  schemes in multi-view learning. Three weight learning paradigms, i.e., Norm Regularization
  (NR), Exponential Decay (ED), and p-th Root Loss (pRL), are widely used in the literature,
  while the relations between them and the limiting behaviors of them are not well
  understood yet. In this paper, we present a Unified Paradigm (UP) that contains
  the aforementioned three popular paradigms as special cases. Specifically, we extend
  the domain of hyper-parameters of NR from positive to real numbers and show this
  extension bridges NR, ED, and pRL. Besides, we provide detailed discussion on the
  weights sparsity, hyper-parameter setting, and counterintuitive limiting behavior
  of these paradigms. Furthermore, we show the generality of our technique with examples
  in Multi-Task Learning and Fuzzy Clustering. Our results may provide insights to
  understand existing algorithms better and inspire research on new weight learning
  schemes. Numerical results support our theoretical analysis.
