title: Variable selection for Gaussian processes via sensitivity analysis of the posterior
  predictive distribution
abstract: Variable selection for Gaussian process models is often done using automatic
  relevance determination, which uses the inverse length-scale parameter of each input
  variable as a proxy for variable relevance. This implicitly determined relevance
  has several drawbacks that prevent the selection of optimal input variables in terms
  of predictive performance. To improve on this, we propose two novel variable selection
  methods for Gaussian process models that utilize the predictions of a full model
  in the vicinity of the training points and thereby rank the variables based on their
  predictive relevance. Our empirical results on synthetic and real world data sets
  demonstrate improved variable selection compared to automatic relevance determination
  in terms of variability and predictive performance.
