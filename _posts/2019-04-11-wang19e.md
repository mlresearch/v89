title: Fixing Mini-batch Sequences with Hierarchical Robust Partitioning
abstract: We propose a general and efficient hierarchical robust partitioning framework
  to generate a deterministic sequence of mini-batches, one that offers assurances
  of being high quality, unlike a randomly drawn sequence.  We compare our deterministically
  generated mini-batch sequences to randomly generated sequences; we show that, on
  a variety of deep learning tasks, the deterministic sequences significantly beat
  the mean and worst case performance of the random sequences, and often outperforms
  the best of the random sequences.  Our theoretical contributions include a new algorithm
  for the robust submodular partition problem subject to cardinality constraints (which
  is used to construct mini-batch sequences), and show in general that the algorithm
  is fast and has good theoretical guarantees; we also show a more efficient hierarchical
  variant of the algorithm with similar guarantees under mild assumptions.
