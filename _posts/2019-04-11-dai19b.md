title: Database Alignment with Gaussian Features
abstract: We consider the problem of aligning a pair of databases with jointly Gaussian
  features. We consider two algorithms, complete database alignment via MAP estimation
  among all possible database alignments, and partial alignment via a thresholding
  approach of log likelihood ratios. We derive conditions on mutual information between
  feature pairs, identifying the regimes where the algorithms are guaranteed to perform
  reliably and those where they cannot be expected to succeed.
