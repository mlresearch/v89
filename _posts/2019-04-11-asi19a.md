title: Modeling simple structures and geometry for better stochastic optimization
  algorithms
abstract: We develop model-based methods for stochastic optimization problems, introducing
  the approximate-proximal point, or aProx, family, which includes stochastic subgradient,
  proximal point, and bundle methods. For appropriately accurate models, the methods
  enjoy stronger convergence and robustness guarantees than classical approaches and
  typically add little to no computational overhead over stochastic subgradient methods.  For
  example, we show that methods using the improved models converge with probability
  1; these methods are also adaptive to a natural class of what we term easy optimization
  problems, achieving linear convergence under appropriate strong growth conditions
  on the objective.  Our experimental investigation shows the advantages of more accurate
  modeling over standard subgradient methods across many smooth and non-smooth, convex
  and non-convex optimization problems.
