title: Vine copula structure learning via Monte Carlo tree search
abstract: Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has been widely adopted in various game and
  planning problems. It can efficiently explore a search space with guided random
  sampling. In statistics, vine copulas are flexible multivariate dependence models
  that adopt vine structures, which are based on a hierarchy of trees to express conditional
  dependence, and bivariate copulas on the edges of the trees. The vine structure
  learning problem has been challenging due to the large search space. To tackle this
  problem, we propose a novel approach to learning vine structures using MCTS. The
  proposed method has significantly better performance over the existing methods under
  various experimental setups.
