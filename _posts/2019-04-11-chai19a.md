title: Improving Quadrature for Constrained Integrands
abstract: 'We present an improved Bayesian framework for performing inference of affine
  transformations of constrained functions. We focus on quadrature with nonnegative
  functions, a common task in Bayesian inference.  We consider constraints on the
  range of the function of interest, such as nonnegativity or boundedness. Although
  our framework is general, we derive explicit approximation schemes for these constraints,
  and argue for the use of a log transformation for functions with high dynamic range
  such as likelihood surfaces. We propose a novel method for optimizing hyperparameters
  in this framework: we optimize the marginal likelihood in the original space, as
  opposed to in the transformed space. The result is a model that better explains
  the actual data. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate our framework
  achieves superior estimates using less wall-clock time than existing Bayesian quadrature
  procedures.'
