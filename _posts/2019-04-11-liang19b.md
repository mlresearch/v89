title: 'Interaction Matters: A Note on Non-asymptotic Local Convergence of Generative
  Adversarial Networks'
abstract: 'Motivated by the pursuit of a systematic computational and algorithmic
  understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we present a simple yet
  unified non-asymptotic local convergence theory for smooth two-player games, which
  subsumes several discrete-time gradient-based saddle point dynamics. The analysis
  reveals the surprising nature of the off-diagonal interaction term as both a blessing
  and a curse. On the one hand, this interaction term explains the origin of the slow-down
  effect in the convergence of Simultaneous Gradient Ascent (SGA) to stable Nash equilibria.
  On the other hand, for the unstable equilibria, exponential convergence can be proved
  thanks to the interaction term, for four modified dynamics proposed to stabilize
  GAN training: Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD), Consensus Optimization (CO), Implicit
  Updates (IU) and Predictive Method (PM). The analysis uncovers the intimate connections
  among these stabilizing techniques, and provides detailed characterization on the
  choice of learning rate. As a by-product, we present a new analysis for OMD proposed
  in Daskalakis, Ilyas, Syrgkanis, and Zeng [2017] with improved rates.'
