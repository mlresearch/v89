title: Augmented Ensemble MCMC sampling in Factorial Hidden Markov Models
abstract: Bayesian inference for Factorial Hidden Markov Models is challenging due
  to the exponentially sized latent variable space. Standard Monte Carlo samplers
  can have difficulties effectively exploring the posterior landscape and are often
  restricted to exploration around localised regions that depend on initialisation.
  We introduce a general purpose ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique
  to improve on existing poorly mixing samplers. This is achieved by combining parallel
  tempering and an auxiliary variable scheme to exchange information between the chains
  in an efficient way. The latter exploits a genetic algorithm within an augmented
  Gibbs sampler. We compare our technique with various existing samplers in a simulation
  study as well as in a cancer genomics application, demonstrating the improvements
  obtained by our augmented ensemble approach.
