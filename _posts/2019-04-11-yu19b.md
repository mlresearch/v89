title: 'Lagrange Coded Computing: Optimal Design for Resiliency, Security, and Privacy'
abstract: We consider a  scenario involving computations over a massive dataset stored
  distributedly across multiple workers, which is at the core of distributed learning
  algorithms. We propose Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC), a new framework to simultaneously
  provide (1) resiliency against stragglers that may prolong computations; (2) security
  against Byzantine (or malicious) workers that deliberately modify the computation
  for their benefit; and (3) (information-theoretic) privacy of the dataset amidst
  possible collusion of workers. LCC, which leverages the well-known Lagrange polynomial
  to create computation redundancy in a novel coded form across workers, can be applied
  to any computation scenario in which the function of interest is an arbitrary multivariate
  polynomial of the input dataset, hence covering many computations of interest in
  machine learning. LCC significantly generalizes prior works to go beyond linear
  computations. It also enables secure and private computing in distributed settings,
  improving the computation and communication efficiency of the state-of-the-art.
  Furthermore, we prove the optimality of LCC by showing that it achieves the optimal
  tradeoff between resiliency, security, and privacy, i.e., in terms of tolerating
  the maximum number of stragglers and adversaries, and providing data privacy against
  the maximum number of colluding workers. Finally, we show via experiments on Amazon
  EC2 that LCC speeds up the conventional uncoded implementation of distributed least-squares
  linear regression by up to $13.43\times$, and also achieves a $2.36\times$-$12.65\times$
  speedup over the state-of-the-art straggler mitigation strategies.
