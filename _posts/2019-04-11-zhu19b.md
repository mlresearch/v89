title: 'Universal Hypothesis Testing with Kernels: Asymptotically Optimal Tests for
  Goodness of Fit'
abstract: We characterize the asymptotic performance of nonparametric goodness of
  fit testing. The exponential decay rate of the type-II error probability is used
  as the asymptotic performance metric, and a test is optimal if it achieves the maximum
  rate subject to a constant level constraint on the type-I error probability. We
  show that two classes of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) based tests attain this
  optimality on $\mathbb R^d$, while the quadratic-time Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD)
  based tests achieve the maximum exponential decay rate under a relaxed level constraint.
  Under the same performance metric, we proceed to show that the quadratic-time MMD
  based two-sample tests are also optimal for general two-sample problems, provided
  that kernels are bounded continuous and characteristic. Key to our approach are
  Sanov’s theorem from large deviation theory and the weak metrizable properties of
  the MMD and KSD.
