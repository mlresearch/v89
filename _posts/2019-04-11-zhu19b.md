title: 'Universal Hypothesis Testing with Kernels: Asymptotically Optimal Tests for
  Goodness of Fit'
abstract: We characterize the asymptotic performance of nonparametric goodness of
  fit testing. The exponential decay rate of the type-II error probability is used
  as the asymptotic performance metric, and a test is optimal if it achieves the maximum
  rate subject to a constant level constraint on the type-I error probability. We
  show that two classes of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) based tests attain this
  optimality on $\mathbb R^d$, while the quadratic-time Kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD)
  based tests achieve the maximum exponential decay rate under a relaxed level constraint.
  Under the same performance metric, we proceed to show that the quadratic-time MMD
  based two-sample tests are also optimal for general two-sample problems, provided
  that kernels are bounded continuous and characteristic. Key to our approach are
  Sanovâ€™s theorem from large deviation theory and the weak metrizable properties of
  the MMD and KSD.
