title: Pathwise Derivatives for Multivariate Distributions
abstract: We exploit the link between the transport equation and derivatives of expectations
  to construct efficient pathwise gradient estimators for multivariate distributions.
  We focus on two main threads. First, we use null solutions of the transport equation
  to construct adaptive control variates that can be used to construct gradient estimators
  with reduced variance. Second, we consider the case of multivariate mixture distributions.
  In particular we show how to compute pathwise derivatives for mixtures of multivariate
  Normal distributions with arbitrary means and diagonal covariances. We demonstrate
  in a variety of experiments in the context of variational inference that our gradient
  estimators can outperform other methods, especially in high dimensions.
