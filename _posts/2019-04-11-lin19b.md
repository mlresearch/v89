title: 'Clustering Time Series with Nonlinear Dynamics: A Bayesian Non-Parametric
  and Particle-Based Approach'
abstract: We propose a general statistical framework for clustering multiple time
  series that exhibit nonlinear dynamics into an a-priori-unknown number of sub-groups.
  Our motivation comes from neuroscience, where an important problem is to identify,
  within a large assembly of neurons, subsets that respond similarly to a stimulus
  or contingency.  Upon modeling the multiple time series as the output of a Dirichlet
  process mixture of nonlinear state-space models, we derive a Metropolis-within-Gibbs
  algorithm for full Bayesian inference that alternates between sampling cluster assignments
  and sampling parameter values that form the basis of the clustering. The Metropolis
  step employs recent innovations in particle-based methods.  We apply the framework
  to clustering time series acquired from the prefrontal cortex of mice in an experiment
  designed to characterize the neural underpinnings of fear.
