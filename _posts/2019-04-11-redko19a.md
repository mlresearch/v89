title: Optimal Transport for Multi-source Domain Adaptation under Target Shift
abstract: 'In this paper, we tackle the problem of reducing discrepancies between
  multiple domains, i.e. multi-source domain adaptation, and consider it under the
  target shift assumption: in all domains we aim to solve a classification problem
  with the same output classes, but with different labels proportions. This problem,
  generally ignored in the vast majority of domain adaptation papers, is nevertheless
  critical in real-world applications, and we theoretically show its impact on the
  success of the adaptation. Our proposed method is based on optimal transport, a
  theory that has been successfully used to tackle adaptation problems in machine
  learning. The introduced approach, Joint Class Proportion and Optimal Transport
  (JCPOT), performs multi-source adaptation and target shift correction simultaneously
  by learning the class probabilities of the unlabeled target sample and the coupling
  allowing to align two (or more) probability distributions. Experiments on both synthetic
  and real-world data (satellite image pixel classification) task show the superiority
  of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art.'
