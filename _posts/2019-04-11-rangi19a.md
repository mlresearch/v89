title: Online learning with feedback graphs and switching costs
abstract: 'We study online learning when partial feedback information is provided
  following every action of the learning process, and the learner incurs switching
  costs for changing his actions.  In this setting, the feedback information system  can
  be represented by a graph, and previous works studied the expected regret of the
  learner in the case of  a clique (Expert setup), or disconnected single loops (Multi-Armed
  Bandits (MAB)). This work provides a lower bound on the expected regret in the Partial
  Information (PI) setting, namely for general feedback graphs –excluding the clique.
  Additionally, it shows that all  algorithms  that are optimal without switching
  costs  are necessarily  sub-optimal in the presence of switching costs, which motivates
  the need to design new algorithms. We propose two new algorithms: Threshold Based
  EXP3 and EXP3.SC.  For the two special cases of  symmetric PI setting and MAB, the
  expected regret of both of these algorithms is order optimal in the duration of
  the learning process. Additionally,  Threshold Based EXP3 is order optimal in the
  switching cost, whereas EXP3.SC   is not.  Finally, empirical evaluations show that
  Threshold Based EXP3 outperforms the  previously proposed order-optimal algorithms   EXP3
  SET in the presence of switching costs, and   Batch EXP3   in the MAB setting with
  switching costs.'
