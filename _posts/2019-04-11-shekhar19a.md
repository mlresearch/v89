title: Multiscale Gaussian Process Level Set Estimation
abstract: In this paper, the problem of estimating the level set of a black-box function
  from noisy and expensive evaluation queries is considered. A new algorithm for this
  problem in the Bayesian framework with a Gaussian Process (GP) prior is proposed.
  The proposed algorithm employs a hierarchical sequence of partitions to explore
  different regions of the search space at varying levels of detail depending upon
  their proximity to the level set boundary. It is shown that this approach results
  in the algorithm having a low complexity implementation whose computational cost
  is significantly smaller than the existing algorithms for higher dimensional search
  space $\X$. Furthermore, high probability bounds on a measure of discrepancy between
  the estimated level set and the true level set for the  the proposed algorithm are
  obtained, which are shown to be strictly better than the existing guarantees for
  a large class of GPs.In the process, a tighter characterization of the information
  gain of the proposed algorithm is obtained which takes into account the structured
  nature of the evaluation points. This approach improves upon the existing technique
  of bounding the information gain with maximum information gain.
