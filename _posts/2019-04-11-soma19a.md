title: No-regret algorithms for online $k$-submodular maximization
abstract: We present a polynomial time algorithm for online maximization of $k$-submodular
  maximization. For online (nonmonotone) $k$-submodular maximization, our algorithm
  achieves a tight approximate factor in the approximate regret. For online monotone
  $k$-submodular maximization, our approximate-regret matches to the best-known approximation
  ratio, which is tight asymptotically as $k$ tends to infinity. Our approach is based
  on the Blackwell approachability theorem and online linear optimization.
