title: 'Multitask Metric Learning: Theory and Algorithm'
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of multitask metric learning (mtML).
  We first examine the generalization bound of the regularized mtML formulation based
  on the notion of algorithmic stability, proving the convergence rate of mtML and
  revealing the trade-off between the tasks. Moreover, we also establish the theoretical
  connection between the mtML, single-task learning and pooling-task learning approaches.
  In addition, we present a novel boosting-based mtML (mt-BML) algorithm, which scales
  well with the feature dimension of the data. Finally, we also devise an efficient
  second-order Riemannian retraction operator which is tailored specifically to our
  mt-BML algorithm. It produces a low-rank solution of mtML to reduce the model complexity,
  and may also improve generalization performances.  Extensive evaluations on several
  benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of our learning algorithm.
