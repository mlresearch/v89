title: Lovasz Convolutional Networks
abstract: Semi-supervised learning on graph structured data has received significant
  attention with the recent introduction of Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). While
  traditional methods have focused on optimizing a loss augmented with Laplacian regularization
  framework, GCNs perform an implicit Laplacian type regularization to capture local
  graph structure. In this work, we propose Lovasz Convolutional Network (LCNs) which
  are capable of incorporating global graph properties. LCNs achieve this by utilizing
  Lovasz’s orthonormal embeddings of the nodes. We analyse local and global properties
  of graphs and demonstrate settings where LCNs tend to work better than GCNs. We
  validate the proposed method on standard random graph models such as stochastic
  block models (SBM) and certain community structure based graphs where LCNs outperform
  GCNs and learn more intuitive embeddings. We also perform extensive binary and multi-class
  classification experiments on real world datasets to demonstrate LCN’s effectiveness.
  In addition to simple graphs, we also demonstrate the use of LCNs on hyper-graphs
  by identifying settings where they are expected to work better than GCNs.
