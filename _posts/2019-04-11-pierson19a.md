title: Inferring Multidimensional Rates of Aging from Cross-Sectional Data
abstract: Modeling how individuals evolve over time is a fundamental problem in the
  natural and social sciences. However, existing datasets are often cross-sectional
  with each individual observed only once, making it impossible to apply traditional
  time-series methods. Motivated by the study of human aging, we present an interpretable
  latent-variable model that learns temporal dynamics from cross-sectional data. Our
  model represents each individualâ€™s features over time as a nonlinear function of
  a low-dimensional, linearly-evolving latent state. We prove that when this nonlinear
  function is constrained to be order-isomorphic, the model family is identifiable
  solely from cross-sectional data provided the distribution of time-independent variation
  is known. On the UK Biobank human health dataset, our model reconstructs the observed
  data while learning interpretable rates of aging associated with diseases, mortality,
  and aging risk factors.
