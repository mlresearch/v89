title: Deep Topic Models for Multi-label Learning
abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for multi-label learning based on a
  deep generative model for the binary label vector associated with each observation.
  Our generative model learns deep multi-layer latent embeddings of the binary label
  vector, which are conditioned on the input features of the observation. The model
  also has an interesting interpretation in terms of a deep topic model, with each
  label vector representing a bag-of-words document, with the input features being
  its meta-data. In addition to capturing the structural properties of the label space
  (e.g., a near-low-rank label matrix), the model also offers a clean, geometric interpretation.
  In particular, the nonlinear classification boundaries learned by the model can
  be seen as the union of multiple convex polytopes. Our model admits a simple and
  scalable inference via efficient Gibbs sampling or EM algorithm. We compare our
  model with state-of-the-art baselines for multi-label learning on  benchmark data
  sets, and also report some interesting qualitative results.
