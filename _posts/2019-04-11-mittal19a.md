title: Domain-Size Aware Markov Logic Networks
abstract: Several domains in AI need to represent the relational structure as well
  as model uncertainty. Markov Logic is a powerful formalism which achieves this by
  attaching weights to formulas in finite first-order logic. Though Markov Logic Networks
  (MLNs) have been used for a wide variety of applications, a significant challenge
  remains that weights do not generalize well when training domain sizes are different
  from those seen during testing. In particular, it has been observed that marginal
  probabilities tend to extremes in the limit of increasing domain sizes. As the first
  contribution of our work, we further characterize the distribution and show that
  marginal probabilities tend to a constant independent of weights and not always
  to extremes as was previously observed. As our second contribution, we present a
  principled solution to this problem by defining Domain-size Aware Markov Logic Networks
  (DA-MLNs) which can be seen as re-parameterizing the MLNs after taking domain size
  into consideration. For some simple but representative MLN formulas, we formally
  prove that probabilities defined by DA-MLNs are well behaved. On a practical side,
  DA-MLNs allow us to generalize the weights learned over small-sized training data
  to much larger domains. Experiments on three different benchmark MLNs show that
  our approach results in significant performance gains compared to existing methods.
