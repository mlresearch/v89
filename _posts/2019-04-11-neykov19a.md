title: Tossing Coins Under Monotonicity
abstract: 'This paper considers the following problem: we are given n coin tosses
  of coins with monotone increasing probability of getting heads (success). We study
  the performance of the monotone constrained likelihood estimate, which is equivalent
  to the estimate produced by isotonic regression. We derive adaptive and non-adaptive
  bounds on the performance of the isotonic estimate, i.e., we demonstrate that for
  some probability vectors the isotonic estimate converges much faster than in general.
  As an application of this framework we propose a two step procedure for the binary
  monotone single index model, which consists of running LASSO and consequently running
  an isotonic regression. We provide thorough numerical studies in support of our
  claims.'
