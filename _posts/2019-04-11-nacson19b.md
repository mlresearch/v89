title: Convergence of Gradient Descent on Separable Data
abstract: 'We provide a detailed study on the implicit bias of gradient descent when
  optimizing loss functions with strictly monotone tails, such as the logistic loss,
  over separable datasets. We look at two basic questions: (a) what are the conditions
  on the tail of the loss function under which gradient descent converges in the direction
  of the $L_2$ maximum-margin separator? (b) how does the rate of margin convergence
  depend on the tail of the loss function and the choice of the step size? We  show
  that for a large family of super-polynomial tailed losses, gradient descent iterates
  on linear networks of any depth converge in the direction of $L_2$ maximum-margin
  solution, while this does not hold for losses with heavier tails. Within this family,
  for simple linear models we show that the optimal rates with fixed step size is
  indeed obtained for the commonly used exponentially tailed losses such as logistic
  loss. However, with a fixed step size the optimal convergence rate is extremely
  slow as $1/\log(t)$, as also proved in Soudry et al (2018). For linear models with
  exponential loss, we further prove that the convergence rate could be improved to
  $\log (t) /\sqrt{t}$  by using aggressive step sizes that compensates for the rapidly
  vanishing gradients. Numerical results suggest this method might be useful for deep
  networks.'
