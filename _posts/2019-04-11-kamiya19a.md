title: Feature subset selection for the multinomial logit model via mixed-integer
  optimization
abstract: This paper is concerned with a feature subset selection problem for the
  multinomial logit (MNL) model. There are several convex approximation algorithms
  for this problem, but to date the only exact algorithms are those for the binomial
  logit model. In this paper, we propose an exact algorithm to solve the problem for
  the MNL model. Our algorithm is based on a mixed-integer optimization approach with
  an outer approximation method. We prove the convergence properties of the algorithm
  for more general models including generalized linear models for multiclass classification.
  We also propose approximation of loss functions to accelerate the algorithm computationally.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that our exact and approximation algorithms achieve
  better generalization performance than does an L1-regularization method.
