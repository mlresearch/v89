title: Safe Convex Learning under Uncertain Constraints
abstract: We address the problem of minimizing a convex smooth function f(x) over
  a compact polyhedral set D given a stochastic zeroth-order constraint feedback model.
  This problem arises in safety-critical machine learning applications, such as personalized
  medicine and robotics. In such cases, one needs to ensure constraints  are satisfied
  while exploring the decision space to find optimum of the loss function. We propose
  a new variant of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which applies to the case of uncertain
  linear constraints. Using robust optimization, we provide the convergence rate of
  the algorithm while guaranteeing feasibility of all iterates, with high probability.
