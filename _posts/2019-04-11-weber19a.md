title: Credit Assignment Techniques in Stochastic Computation Graphs
abstract: Stochastic computation graphs (SCGs) provide a formalism to represent structured
  optimization problems arising in artificial intelligence, including supervised,
  unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that an unbiased
  estimator of the gradient of the expected loss of SCGs can be derived from a single
  principle. However, this estimator often has high variance and requires a full model
  evaluation per data point, making this algorithm costly in large graphs. In this
  work, we address these problems by generalizing concepts from the reinforcement
  learning literature. We introduce the concepts of value functions, baselines and
  critics for arbitrary SCGs, and show how to use them to derive lower-variance gradient
  estimates from partial model evaluations, paving the way towards general and efficient
  credit assignment for gradient-based optimization. In doing so, we demonstrate how
  our results unify recent advances in the probabilistic inference and reinforcement
  learning literature.
