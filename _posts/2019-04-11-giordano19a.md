title: A Swiss Army Infinitesimal Jackknife
abstract: The error or variability of machine learning algorithms is often assessed
  by repeatedly refitting a model with different weighted versions of the observed
  data. The ubiquitous tools of cross-validation (CV) and the bootstrap are examples
  of this technique. These methods are powerful in large part due to their model agnosticism
  but can be slow to run on modern, large data sets due to the need to repeatedly
  re-fit the model. In this work, we use a linear approximation to the dependence
  of the fitting procedure on the weights, producing results that can be faster than
  repeated re-fitting by an order of magnitude. This linear approximation is sometimes
  known as the "infinitesimal jackknife" in the statistics literature, where it is
  mostly used as a theoretical tool to prove asymptotic results. We provide explicit
  finite-sample error bounds for the infinitesimal jackknife in terms of a small number
  of simple, verifiable assumptions. Our results apply whether the weights and data
  are stochastic or deterministic, and so can be used as a tool for proving the accuracy
  of the infinitesimal jackknife on a wide variety of problems. As a corollary, we
  state mild regularity conditions under which our approximation consistently estimates
  true leave k-out cross-validation for any fixed k. These theoretical results, together
  with modern automatic differentiation software, support the application of the infinitesimal
  jackknife to a wide variety of practical problems in machine learning, providing
  a "Swiss Army infinitesimal jackknife." We demonstrate the accuracy of our methods
  on a range of simulated and real datasets.
