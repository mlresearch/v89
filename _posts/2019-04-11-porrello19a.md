title: Classifying Signals on Irregular Domains via Convolutional Cluster Pooling
abstract: We present a novel and hierarchical approach for supervised classification
  of signals spanning over a fixed graph, reflecting shared properties of the dataset.
  To this end, we introduce a Convolutional Cluster Pooling layer exploiting a multi-scale
  clustering in order to highlight, at different resolutions, locally connected regions
  on the input graph. Our proposal generalises well-established neural models such
  as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on irregular and complex domains, by means
  of the exploitation of the weight sharing property in a graph-oriented architecture.
  In this work, such property is based on the centrality of each vertex within its
  soft-assigned cluster. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, CIFAR-10 and 20NEWS demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed technique in capturing both local and global patterns
  in graph-structured data out of different domains.
