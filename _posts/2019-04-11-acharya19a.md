title: 'Hadamard Response: Estimating Distributions Privately, Efficiently, and with
  Little Communication'
abstract: We study the problem of estimating $k$-ary distributions under $\eps$-local
  differential privacy. $n$ samples are distributed across users who send privatized
  versions of their sample to a central server. All previously known sample optimal
  algorithms require linear (in $k$) communication from each user in the high privacy
  regime $(\eps=O(1))$, and run in time that grows as $n\cdot k$, which can be prohibitive
  for large domain size $k$.   We propose Hadamard Response (HR), a local privatization
  scheme that requires no shared randomness and is symmetric with respect to the users.
  Our scheme has order optimal sample complexity for all $\eps$, a communication of
  at most $\log k+2$ bits per user, and nearly linear running time of $\tilde{O}(n
  + k)$.   Our encoding and decoding are based on Hadamard matrices and are simple
  to implement. The statistical performance relies on the coding theoretic aspects
  of Hadamard matrices, ie, the large Hamming distance between the rows. An efficient
  implementation of the algorithm using the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform gives the
  computational gains.  We compare our approach with Randomized Response (RR), RAPPOR,
  and subset-selection mechanisms (SS), both theoretically, and experimentally. For
  $k=10000$, our algorithm runs about 100x faster than SS, and RAPPOR.
