title: Markov Properties of Discrete Determinantal Point Processes
abstract: Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models for repulsion.
  When used to represent the occurrence of random subsets of a finite base set, DPPs
  allow to model global negative associations in a mathematically elegant and direct
  way. Discrete DPPs have become popular and computationally tractable models for
  solving several machine learning tasks that require the selection of diverse objects,
  and have been successfully applied in numerous real-life problems. Despite their
  popularity, the statistical properties of such models have not been adequately explored.
  In this note, we derive the Markov properties of discrete DPPs and show how they
  can be expressed using graphical models.
