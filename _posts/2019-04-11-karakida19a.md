title: 'Universal Statistics of Fisher Information in Deep Neural Networks: Mean Field
  Approach'
abstract: The Fisher information matrix (FIM) is a fundamental quantity to represent
  the characteristics of a stochastic model, including deep neural networks (DNNs).
  The present study reveals novel statistics of FIM that are universal among a wide
  class of DNNs. To this end, we use random weights and large width limits, which
  enables us to utilize mean field theories. We investigate the asymptotic statistics
  of the FIMâ€™s eigenvalues and reveal that most of them are close to zero while the
  maximum eigenvalue takes a huge value. Because the landscape of the parameter space
  is defined by the FIM, it is locally flat in most dimensions, but strongly distorted
  in others. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential usage of the derived statistics
  in learning strategies. First, small eigenvalues that induce flatness can be connected
  to a norm-based capacity measure of generalization ability. Second, the maximum
  eigenvalue that induces the distortion enables us to quantitatively estimate an
  appropriately sized learning rate for gradient methods to converge.
