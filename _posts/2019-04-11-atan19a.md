title: Sequential Patient Recruitment and Allocation for Adaptive Clinical Trials
abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for comparing
  the effectiveness of a new treatment to the current one (the control).  Most RCTs
  allocate the patients to the treatment group and the control group by uniform randomization.  We
  show that this procedure can be highly sub-optimal (in terms of learning) if – as
  is often the case – patients can be recruited in cohorts (rather than all at once),
  the effects on each cohort can be observed before recruiting the next cohort, and
  the effects are heterogeneous across identifiable subgroups of patients. We formulate
  the patient allocation problem as a finite stage Markov Decision Process in which
  the objective is to minimize a given weighted combination of type-I and type-II
  errors.  Because finding the exact solution to this Markov Decision Process is computationally
  intractable, we propose an algorithm Knowledge Gradient for Randomized Controlled
  Trials (RCT-KG) – that yields an approximate solution. Our experiment on a synthetic
  dataset with Bernoulli outcomes shows that for a given size of trial our method
  achieves significant reduction in error, and to achieve a prescribed level of confidence
  (in identifying whether the treatment is superior to the control), our method requires
  many fewer patients.
