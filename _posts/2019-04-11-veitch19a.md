title: Empirical Risk Minimization and Stochastic Gradient Descent for Relational
  Data
abstract: 'Empirical risk minimization is the main tool for prediction problems, but
  its extension to relational data remains unsolved. We solve this problem using recent
  ideas from graph sampling theory to (i) define an empirical risk for relational
  data and (ii) obtain stochastic gradients for this empirical risk that are automatically
  unbiased. This is achieved by considering the method by which data is sampled from
  a graph as an explicit component of model design. By integrating fast implementations
  of graph sampling schemes with standard automatic differentiation tools, we provide
  an efficient turnkey solver for the risk minimization problem. We establish basic
  theoretical properties of the procedure. Finally, we demonstrate relational ERM
  with application to two non-standard problems: one-stage training for semi-supervised
  node classification, and learning embedding vectors for vertex attributes. Experiments
  confirm that the turnkey inference procedure is effective in practice, and that
  the sampling scheme used for model specification has a strong effect on model performance.'
