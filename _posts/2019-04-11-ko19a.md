title: Optimal Minimization of the Sum of Three Convex Functions with a Linear Operator
abstract: We propose a class of optimal-rate primal-dual algorithms for minimization
  of the sum of three convex functions with a linear operator. We first establish
  the optimal convergence rates for solving the saddle-point reformulation of the
  problem only using first-order information under deterministic and stochastic settings,
  respectively. We then proceed to show that the proposed algorithm class achieves
  these rates. The studied algorithm class does not require matrix inversion and is
  simple to implement. To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish and attain
  the optimal rates for this class of problems with minimal assumptions. Numerical
  experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
