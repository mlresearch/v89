title: Gaussian Regression with Convex Constraints
abstract: The focus of this paper is the linear model with Gaussian design under convex
  constraints. Specifically, we study the performance of the constrained least squares
  estimate. We derive two general results characterizing its performance - one requiring
  a tangent cone structure, and one which holds in a general setting. We use our general
  results to analyze three functional shape constrained problems where the signal
  is generated from an underlying Lipschitz, monotone or convex function. In each
  of the examples we show specific classes of functions which achieve fast adaptive
  estimation rates, and we also provide non-adaptive estimation rates which hold for
  any function. Our results demonstrate that the Lipschitz, monotone and convex constraints
  allow one to analyze regression problems even in high-dimensional settings where
  the dimension may scale as the square or fourth degree of the sample size respectively.
