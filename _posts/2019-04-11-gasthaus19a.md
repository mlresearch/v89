title: Probabilistic Forecasting with Spline Quantile Function RNNs
abstract: In this paper, we propose a flexible method for probabilistic modeling with
  conditional quantile functions using monotonic regression splines. The shape of
  the spline is parameterized by a neural network whose parameters are learned by
  minimizing the continuous ranked probability score. Within this framework, we propose
  a method for probabilistic time series forecasting, which combines the modeling
  capacity of recurrent neural networks with the flexibility of a spline-based representation
  of the output distribution. Unlike methods based on parametric probability density
  functions and maximum likelihood estimation, the proposed method can flexibly adapt
  to different output distributions without manual intervention. We empirically demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the approach  on synthetic and real-world data sets.
