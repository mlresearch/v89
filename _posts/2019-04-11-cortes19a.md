title: Region-Based Active Learning
abstract: We study a scenario of active learning where the input space is partitioned
  into different regions and where a distinct hypothesis is learned for each region.  We
  first introduce a new active learning algorithm (EIWAL), which is an enhanced version
  of the IWAL algorithm, based on a finer analysis that results in more favorable
  learning guarantees.  Then, we present a new learning algorithm for region-based
  active learning, ORIWAL, in which either IWAL or EIWAL serve as a subroutine. ORIWAL
  optimally allocates points to the subroutine algorithm for each region.  We give
  a detailed theoretical analysis of ORIWAL, including generalization error guarantees
  and bounds on the number of points labeled, in terms of both the hypothesis set
  used in each region and the probability mass of that region.  We also report the
  results of several experiments for our algorithm which demonstrate substantial benefits
  over existing non-region-based active learning algorithms, such as IWAL, and over
  passive learning.
