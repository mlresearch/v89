title: Performance Metric Elicitation from Pairwise Classifier Comparisons
abstract: Given a binary prediction problem, which performance metric should the classifier
  optimize? We address this question by formalizing the problem of Metric Elicitation.
  The goal of metric elicitation is to discover the performance metric of a practitioner,
  which reflects her innate rewards (costs) for correct (incorrect) classification.
  In particular, we focus on eliciting binary classification performance metrics from
  pairwise feedback, where a practitioner is queried to provide relative preference
  between two classifiers. By exploiting key geometric properties of the space of
  confusion matrices, we obtain provably query efficient algorithms for eliciting
  linear and linear-fractional performance metrics. We further show that our method
  is robust to feedback and finite sample noise.
