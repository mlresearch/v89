title: Probabilistic Riemannian submanifold learning with wrapped Gaussian process
  latent variable models
abstract: Latent variable models (LVMs) learn probabilistic models of data manifolds
  lying in an ambient Euclidean space. In a number of applications, a priori known
  spatial constraints can shrink the ambient space into a considerably smaller manifold.  Additionally,
  in these applications the Euclidean geometry might induce a suboptimal similarity
  measure, which could be improved by choosing a different metric. Euclidean models
  ignore such information and assign probability mass to data points that can never
  appear as data, and vastly different likelihoods to points that are similar under
  the desired metric.We propose the wrapped Gaussian process latent variable model
  (WGPLVM), that extends Gaussian process latent variable models to take values strictly
  on a given Riemannian manifold, making the model blind to impossible data points.
  This allows non-linear, probabilistic inference of low-dimensional Riemannian submanifolds
  from data. Our evaluation on diverse datasets show that we improve performance on
  several tasks, including encoding, visualization and uncertainty quantification.
