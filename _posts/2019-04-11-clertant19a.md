title: Interpretable Cascade Classifiers with Abstention
abstract: In many prediction tasks such as medical diagnostics, sequential  decisions
  are crucial to provide optimal individual treatment. Budget in real-life applications
  is always limited, and it can represent any limited resource such as time, money,
  or side effects of medications. In this contribution, we develop a POMDP-based framework
  to learn cost-sensitive heterogeneous cascading systems. We provide both the theoretical
  support for the introduced approach and the intuition behind it. We evaluate our
  novel method on some standard benchmarks, and we discuss how the learned models
  can be interpreted by human experts.
