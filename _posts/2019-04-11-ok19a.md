title: Iterative Bayesian Learning for Crowdsourced Regression
abstract: Crowdsourcing platforms emerged as popular venues for purchasing human intelligence
  at low cost for large volume of tasks. As many low-paid workers are prone to give
  noisy answers, a common practice is to add redundancy by assigning multiple workers
  to each task and then simply average out these answers. However, to fully harness
  the wisdom of the crowd, one needs to learn the heterogeneous quality of each worker.
  We resolve this fundamental challenge in crowdsourced regression tasks, i.e., the
  answer takes continuous labels, where identifying good or bad workers becomes much
  more non-trivial compared to a classification setting of discrete labels. In particular,
  we introduce a Bayesian iterative scheme and show that it provably achieves the
  optimal mean squared error. Our evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
  support our theoretical results and show the superiority of the proposed scheme.
