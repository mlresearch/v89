title: A new evaluation framework for topic modeling algorithms based on synthetic
  corpora
abstract: Topic models are in widespread use in natural language processing and beyond.
  Here, we propose a new framework for the evaluation of topic modeling algorithms
  based on synthetic corpora containing an unambiguously defined ground truth topic
  structure. The major innovation of our approach is the ability to quantify the agreement
  between the planted and inferred topic structures by comparing the assigned topic
  labels at the level of the tokens. In experiments, our approach yields novel insights
  about the relative strengths of topic models as corpus characteristics vary, and
  the first evidence of an “undetectable phase” for topic models when the planted
  structure is weak. We also establish the practical relevance of the insights gained
  for synthetic corpora by predicting the performance of topic modeling algorithms
  in classification tasks in real-world corpora.
