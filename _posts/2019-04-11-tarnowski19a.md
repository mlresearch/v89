title: Dynamical Isometry is Achieved in Residual Networks in a Universal Way for
  any Activation Function
abstract: We demonstrate that in residual neural networks (ResNets) dynamical isometry
  is achievable irrespective of the activation function used. We do that by deriving,
  with the help of Free Probability and Random Matrix Theories, a universal formula
  for the spectral density of the input-output Jacobian at initialization, in the
  large network width and depth limit. The resulting singular value spectrum depends
  on a single parameter, which we calculate for a variety of popular activation functions,
  by analyzing the signal propagation in the artificial neural network. We corroborate
  our results with numerical simulations of both random matrices and ResNets applied
  to the CIFAR-10 classification problem. Moreover, we study consequences of this
  universal behavior for the initial and late phases of the learning processes.  We
  conclude by drawing attention to the simple fact, that initialization acts as a
  confounding factor between the choice of activation function and the rate of learning.
  We propose that in ResNets this can be resolved based on our results by ensuring
  the same level of dynamical isometry at initialization.
