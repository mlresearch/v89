title: 'On Constrained Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization: A Case Study for Generalized
  Eigenvalue Decomposition'
abstract: 'We study constrained nonconvex optimization problems in machine learning
  and signal processing. It is well-known that these problems can be rewritten to
  a min-max problem in a Lagrangian form. However, due to the lack of convexity, their
  landscape is not well understood and how to find the stable equilibria of the Lagrangian
  function is still unknown. To bridge the gap, we study the landscape of the Lagrangian
  function. Further, we define a special class of Lagrangian functions. They enjoy
  the following two properties: 1. Equilibria are either stable or unstable (Formal
  definition in Section 2); 2.Stable equilibria correspond to the global optima of
  the original problem. We show that a generalized eigenvalue (GEV) problem, including
  canonical correlation analysis and other problems as special examples, belongs to
  the class. Specifically, we characterize its stable and unstable equilibria by leveraging
  an invariant group and symmetric property (more details in Section 3). Motivated
  by these neat geometric structures, we propose a simple, efficient, and stochastic
  primal-dual algorithm solving the online GEV problem. Theoretically, under sufficient
  conditions, we establish an asymptotic rate of convergence and obtain the first
  sample complexity result for the online GEV problem by diffusion approximations,
  which are widely used in applied probability. Numerical results are also provided
  to support our theory.'
