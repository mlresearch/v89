title: 'Test without Trust: Optimal Locally Private Distribution Testing'
abstract: We study the problem of distribution testing when the samples can only be
  accessed using a locally differentially private mechanism and focus on two representative
  testing questions of identity (goodness-of-fit) and independence testing for discrete
  distributions. First, we construct tests that use existing, general-purpose locally   differentially
  private mechanisms such as the popular RAPPOR or the recently introduced Hadamard
  Response for collecting data and show  that our proposed tests are sample optimal,
  when we insist on using these mechanisms. Next, we allow bespoke mechanisms designed
  specifically for testing and introduce the Randomized Aggregated Private Testing
  Optimal Response (RAPTOR) mechanism  which is remarkably simple and requires only
  one bit of communication per sample. We show that our proposed mechanism yields
  sample-optimal tests, and in particular outperforms any test based on RAPPOR or
  Hadamard response. A distinguishing feature of our optimal mechanism is that, in
  contrast to existing mechanisms, it uses public randomness.
