title: Adaptive Gaussian Copula ABC
abstract: Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a set of techniques for Bayesian
  inference when the likelihood is intractable but sampling from the model is possible.
  This work presents a simple yet effective ABC algorithm based on the combination
  of two classical ABC approaches — regression ABC and sequential ABC. The key idea
  is that rather than learning the posterior directly, we first target another auxiliary
  distribution that can be learned accurately by existing methods, through which we
  then subsequently learn the desired posterior with the help of a Gaussian copula.
  During this process, the complexity of the model changes adaptively according to
  the data at hand. Experiments on a synthetic dataset as well as three real-world
  inference tasks demonstrates that the proposed method is fast, accurate, and easy
  to use.
