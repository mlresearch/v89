title: A Family of Exact Goodness-of-Fit Tests for High-Dimensional Discrete Distributions
abstract: The objective of goodness-of-fit testing is to assess whether a dataset
  of observations is likely to have been drawn from a candidate probability distribution.
  This paper presents a rank-based family of goodness-of-fit tests that is specialized
  to discrete distributions on high-dimensional domains. The test is readily implemented
  using a simulation-based, linear-time procedure. The testing procedure can be customized
  by the practitioner using knowledge of the underlying data domain. Unlike most existing
  test statistics, the proposed test statistic is distribution-free and its exact
  (non-asymptotic) sampling distribution is known in closed form. We establish consistency
  of the test against all alternatives by showing that the test statistic is distributed
  as a discrete uniform if and only if the samples were drawn from the candidate distribution.
  We illustrate its efficacy for assessing the sample quality of approximate sampling
  algorithms over combinatorially large spaces with intractable probabilities, including
  random partitions in Dirichlet process mixture models and random lattices in Ising
  models.
