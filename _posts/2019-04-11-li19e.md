title: Nonconvex Matrix Factorization from Rank-One Measurements
abstract: 'We consider the problem of recovering low-rank matrices from random rank-one
  measurements, which spans numerous applications including phase retrieval, quantum
  state tomography, and learning shallow neural networks with quadratic activations,
  among others. Our approach is to directly estimate the low-rank factor by minimizing
  a nonconvex least-squares loss function via vanilla gradient descent, following
  a tailored spectral initialization. When the true rank is small, this algorithm
  is guaranteed to converge to the ground truth (up to global ambiguity) with near-optimal
  sample and computational complexities with respect to the problem size. To the best
  of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical guarantee that achieves near optimality
  in both metrics. In particular, the key enabler of near-optimal computational guarantees
  is an implicit regularization phenomenon: without explicit regularization, both
  spectral initialization and the gradient descent iterates automatically stay within
  a region incoherent with the measurement vectors. This feature allows one to employ
  much more aggressive step sizes compared with the ones suggested in prior literature,
  without the need of sample splitting.'
