title: 'SpikeCaKe: Semi-Analytic Nonparametric Bayesian Inference for Spike-Spike
  Neuronal Connectivity'
abstract: In this paper we introduce a semi-analytic variational framework for approximating
  the posterior of a Gaussian processes coupled through non-linear emission models.
  While the semi-analytic method can be applied to a large class of models, the present
  paper is devoted to the analysis of causal connectivity between biological spiking
  neurons. Estimating causal connectivity between spiking neurons from measured spike
  sequences is one of the main challenges of systems neuroscience. This semi-analytic
  method exploits the tractability of GP regression when the membrane potential is
  observed. The resulting posterior is then marginalized analytically in order to
  obtain the posterior of the response functions given the spike sequences alone.
  We validate our methods on both simulated data and real neuronal recordings.
