title: Binary Space Partitioning Forest
abstract: The Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)-Tree process is proposed to produce
  flexible 2-D partition structures which are originally used as a Bayesian nonparametric
  prior for relational modelling. It can hardly be applied to other learning tasks
  such as regression trees because extending the BSP-Tree process to a higher dimensional
  space is nontrivial. This paper is the first attempt to extend the BSP-Tree process
  to a d-dimensional ($d>2$) space. We propose to generate a cutting hyperplane, which
  is assumed to be parallel to $d-2$ dimensions, to cut each node in the d-dimensional
  BSP-tree. By designing a subtle strategy to sample two free dimensions from d dimensions,
  the extended BSP-Tree process can inherit the essential self-consistency property
  from the original version. Based on the extended BSP-Tree process, an ensemble model,
  which is named the BSP-Forest, is further developed for regression tasks. Thanks
  to the retained self-consistency property, we can thus significantly reduce the
  geometric calculations in the inference stage. Compared to its counterpart, the
  Mondrian Forest, the BSP-Forest can achieve similar performance with fewer cuts
  due to its flexibility. The BSP-Forest also outperforms other (Bayesian) regression
  forests on a number of real-world data sets.
