title: Provable Robustness of ReLU networks via Maximization of Linear Regions
abstract: It has been shown that neural network classifiers are not robust. This raises
  concerns about their usage in safety-critical systems. We propose in this paper
  a regularization scheme for ReLU networks which provably improves the robustness
  of the classifier by maximizing the linear regions of the classifier as well as
  the distance to the decision boundary. Using our regularization we can even find
  the minimal adversarial perturbation for a certain fraction of test points for large
  networks. In the experiments we show that our approach improves upon pure adversarial
  training both in terms of lower and upper bounds on the robustness and is comparable
  or better than the state of the art in terms of test error and robustness.
