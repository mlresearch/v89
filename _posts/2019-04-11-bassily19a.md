title: Linear Queries Estimation with Local Differential Privacy
abstract: We study the problem of estimating a set of d linear queries with respect
  to some unknown distribution p over a domain $[J]$ based on a sensitive data set
  of n individuals under the constraint of local differential privacy. This problem
  subsumes a wide range of estimation tasks, e.g., distribution estimation and d-dimensional
  mean estimation. We provide new algorithms for both the offline (non-adaptive) and
  adaptive versions of this problem.   In the offline setting, the set of queries
  are  fixed before the algorithm starts. In the regime where $n < d^2/\log(J)$, our
  algorithms attain $L_2$ estimation error that is independent of d. For the special
  case of distribution estimation, we show that projecting the output estimate of
  an algorithm due to [Acharya et al. 2018] on the probability simplex yields an $L_2$
  error that depends only sub-logarithmically on $J$ in the regime where $n < J^2/\log(J)$.
  Our bounds are within a factor of at most $(\log(J))^{1/4}$ from the optimal $L_2$
  error. These results show the possibility of accurate estimation of linear queries
  in the high-dimensional settings under the $L_2$ error criterion.  In the adaptive
  setting, the queries are generated over d rounds; one query at a time. In each round,
  a query can be chosen adaptively based on all the history of previous queries and
  answers. We give an algorithm for this problem with optimal $L_{\infty}$ estimation
  error (worst error in the estimated values for the queries w.r.t. the data distribution).
  Our bound matches a lower bound on the $L_{\infty}$ error in the offline version
  of this problem [Duchi et al. 2013].
