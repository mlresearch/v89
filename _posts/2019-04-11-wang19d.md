title: Stochastic Variance-Reduced Cubic Regularization for Nonconvex Optimization
abstract: Cubic regularization (CR) is an optimization method with emerging popularity
  due to its capability to escape saddle points and converge to second-order stationary
  solutions for nonconvex optimization. However, CR encounters a high sample complexity
  issue for finite-sum problems with a large data size. Various inexact variants of  CR
  have been proposed to improve the sample complexity. In this paper, we propose a
  stochastic variance-reduced cubic-regularization (SVRC) method under random sampling,
  and study its convergence guarantee as well as sample complexity. We show that the
  iteration complexity of SVRC for achieving a second-order stationary solution within
  $\epsilon$ accuracy is $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, which matches the state-of-art result
  on CR types methods. Moreover, our proposed variance reduction scheme significantly
  reduces the per-iteration sample complexity. The resulting total Hessian sample
  complexity of our SVRC is $O(N^{2/3} \epsilon^{-3/2})$, which outperforms the state-of-art
  result by a factor of $O(N^{2/15})$. We also study our SVRC under random sampling
  without replacement scheme, which yields a lower per-iteration sample complexity,
  and hence justifies its practical applicability.
