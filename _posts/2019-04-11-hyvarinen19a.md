title: Nonlinear ICA Using Auxiliary Variables and Generalized Contrastive Learning
abstract: Nonlinear ICA is a fundamental problem for unsupervised representation learning,
  emphasizing the capacity to recover the underlying latent variables generating the
  data (i.e., identifiability). Recently, the very first identifiability proofs for
  nonlinear ICA have been proposed, leveraging the temporal structure of the independent
  components. Here, we propose a general framework for nonlinear ICA, which, as a
  special case, can make use of temporal structure. It is based on augmenting the
  data by an auxiliary variable, such as the time index, the history of the time series,
  or any other available information. We propose to learn  nonlinear ICA by discriminating
  between true augmented data, or data in which the auxiliary variable has been randomized.  This
  enables  the framework to be implemented algorithmically through logistic regression,
  possibly in a neural network. We provide a comprehensive proof of the identifiability
  of the model as well as the consistency of our estimation method. The approach not
  only provides a general theoretical framework combining and generalizing  previously
  proposed nonlinear ICA models and algorithms, but also brings practical advantages.
