title: Sample Efficient Graph-Based Optimization with Noisy Observations
abstract: We study sample complexity of optimizing “hill-climbing friendly” functions
  defined on a graph under noisy observations. We define a notion of convexity, and
  we show that a variant of best-arm identification can find a near-optimal solution
  after a small number of queries that is independent of the size of the graph. For
  functions that have local minima and are nearly convex, we show a sample complexity
  for the classical simulated annealing under noisy observations. We show effectiveness
  of the greedy algorithm with restarts and the simulated annealing on problems of
  graph-based nearest neighbor classification as well as a web advertising application.
