title: Estimating Network Structure from Incomplete Event Data
abstract: Multivariate Bernoulli autoregressive (BAR) processes model time series
  of events in which the likelihood of current events is determined by the times and
  locations of past events. These processes can be used to model nonlinear dynamical
  systems corresponding to criminal activity, responses of patients to different medical
  treatment plans, opinion dynamics across social networks, epidemic spread, and more.
  Past work examines this problem under the assumption that the event data is complete,
  but in many cases only a fraction of events are observed. Incomplete observations
  pose a significant challenge in this setting because the unobserved events still
  govern the underlying dynamical system. In this work, we develop a novel approach
  to estimating the parameters of a BAR process in the presence of unobserved events
  via an unbiased estimator of the complete data log-likelihood function. We propose
  a computationally efficient estimation algorithm which approximates this estimator
  via Taylor series truncation and establish theoretical results for both the statistical
  error and optimization error of our algorithm. We further justify our approach by
  testing our method on both simulated data and a real data set consisting of crimes
  recorded by the city of Chicago.
