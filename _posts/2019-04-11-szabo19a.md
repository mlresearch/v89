title: On Kernel Derivative Approximation with Random Fourier Features
abstract: Random Fourier features (RFF) represent one of the most popular and wide-spread
  techniques in machine learning to scale up kernel algorithms. Despite the numerous
  successful applications of RFFs, unfortunately, quite little is understood theoretically
  on their optimality and limitations of their performance. Only recently, precise
  statistical-computational trade-offs have been established for RFFs in the approximation
  of kernel values, kernel ridge regression, kernel PCA and SVM classification. Our
  goal is to spark the investigation of optimality of RFF-based approximations in
  tasks involving not only function values but derivatives, which naturally lead to
  optimization problems with kernel derivatives. Particularly, in this paper, we focus
  on the approximation quality of RFFs for kernel derivatives and prove that the existing
  finite-sample guarantees can be improved exponentially in terms of the domain where
  they hold, using recent tools from unbounded empirical process theory. Our result
  implies that the same approximation guarantee is attainable for kernel derivatives
  using RFF as achieved for kernel values.
