title: Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandit with Probabilistically
  Triggered Arms
abstract: We analyze the regret of combinatorial Thompson sampling (CTS) for the combinatorial
  multi-armed bandit with probabilistically triggered arms under the semi-bandit feedback
  setting. We assume that the learner has access to an exact optimization oracle but
  does not know the expected base arm outcomes beforehand. When the expected reward
  function is Lipschitz continuous in the expected base arm outcomes, we derive $O(\sum_{i
  =1}^m \log T / (p_i \Delta_i))$ regret bound for CTS, where $m$ denotes the number
  of base arms, $p_i$ denotes the minimum non-zero triggering probability of base
  arm $i$ and $\Delta_i$ denotes the minimum suboptimality gap of base arm $i$. We
  also compare CTS with combinatorial upper confidence bound (CUCB) via numerical
  experiments on a cascading bandit problem.
