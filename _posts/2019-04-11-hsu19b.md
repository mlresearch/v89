title: Correspondence Analysis Using Neural Networks
abstract: Correspondence analysis (CA) is a multivariate statistical tool used to
  visualize and interpret data dependencies. CA has found applications in fields ranging
  from epidemiology to social sciences. However, current methods used to perform CA
  do not scale to large, high-dimensional datasets. By re-interpreting the objective
  in CA using an information-theoretic tool called the principal inertia components,
  we demonstrate that performing CA is equivalent to solving a functional optimization
  problem over the space of finite variance functions of two random variable. We show
  that this optimization problem, in turn, can be efficiently approximated by neural
  networks. The resulting formulation, called the correspondence analysis neural network
  (CA-NN), enables CA to be performed at an unprecedented scale. We validate the CA-NN
  on synthetic data, and demonstrate how it can be used to perform CA on a variety
  of datasets, including food recipes, wine compositions, and images. Our results
  outperform traditional methods used in CA, indicating that CA-NN can serve as a
  new, scalable tool for interpretability and visualization of complex dependencies
  between random variables.
