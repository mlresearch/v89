title: Rotting bandits are no harder than stochastic ones
abstract: In stochastic multi-armed bandits, the reward distribution of each arm is
  assumed to be stationary. This assumption is often violated in practice (e.g., in
  recommendation systems), where the reward of an arm may change whenever is selected,
  i.e., rested bandit setting. In this paper, we consider the non-parametric rotting
  bandit setting, where rewards can only decrease. We introduce the filtering on expanding
  window average (FEWA) algorithm that constructs moving averages of increasing windows
  to identify arms that are more likely to return high rewards when pulled once more.
  We prove that for an unknown horizon T, and without any knowledge on the decreasing
  behavior of the K arms, FEWA achieves problem-dependent regret bound of $O(\log(KT))$,
  and a problem-independent one of $O(\sqrt(KT))$. Our result substantially improves
  over the algorithm of Levine et al. (2017), which suffers regret $O(K^(1/3) T^(2/3)$.
  FEWA also matches known bounds for the stochastic bandit setting, thus showing that
  the rotting bandits are not harder. Finally, we report simulations confirming the
  theoretical improvements of FEWA.
