title: 'SPONGE: A generalized eigenproblem for clustering signed networks'
abstract: We introduce a principled and theoretically sound spectral method for k-way
  clustering in signed graphs, where the affinity measure between nodes takes either
  positive or negative values. Our approach is motivated by social balance theory,
  where the task of clustering aims to decompose the network into disjoint groups
  such that individuals within the same group are connected by as many positive edges
  as possible, while individuals from different groups are connected by as many negative
  edges as possible. Our algorithm relies on a generalized eigenproblem formulation
  inspired by recent work on constrained clustering. We provide theoretical guarantees
  for our approach in the setting of a signed  stochastic block model, by leveraging
  tools from matrix perturbation theory and random matrix theory. An extensive set
  of numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data shows that our approach
  compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods for signed clustering, especially
  for large number of clusters and sparse measurement graphs.
