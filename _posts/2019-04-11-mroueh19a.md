title: Sobolev Descent
abstract: 'We study a simplification of GAN training: the problem of transporting
  particles from a source to a target distribution. Starting from the Sobolev GAN
  critic, part of the gradient  regularized GAN family, we show a strong relation
  with Optimal Transport (OT). Specifically with the less popular *dynamic* formulation
  of OT that finds a path of distributions from source to target minimizing a "kinetic
  energy". We introduce Sobolev descent that constructs similar paths by following  gradient
  flows of a critic function in a kernel space or parametrized  by a neural network.
  In the kernel version, we show convergence to the target distribution in the MMD
  sense. We show in theory and experiments that regularization has an important role
  in favoring smooth transitions between distributions, avoiding large gradients from
  the critic. This analysis in a simplified particle setting provides insight in paths
  to equilibrium in GANs.'
