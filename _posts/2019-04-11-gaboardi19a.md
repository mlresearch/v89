title: 'Locally Private Mean Estimation: $Z$-test and Tight Confidence Intervals'
abstract: This work provides tight upper- and lower-bounds for the problem of mean
  estimation under differential privacy in the local-model, when the input is composed
  of $n$ i.i.d. drawn samples from a Gaussian. Our algorithms result in a $(1-\beta)$-confidence
  interval for the underlying distributionâ€™s mean of length   $O(\sigma *sqrt(log(n/beta)log(1/\beta))/(\epsilon*sqrt(n))$.
  In addition, our algorithms leverage on binary search using local differential privacy
  for quantile estimation, a result which may be of separate interest. Moreover, our
  algorithms have a matching lower-bound, where we prove that any one-shot (each individual
  is presented with a single query) local differentially private algorithm must return
  an interval of length $\Omega(\sigma*sqrt(\log(1/\beta))/(\epsilon*sqrt(n)))$.
