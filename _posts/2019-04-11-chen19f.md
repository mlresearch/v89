title: Projection-Free Bandit Convex Optimization
abstract: In this paper, we propose the first computationally efficient projection-free
  algorithm for bandit convex optimization (BCO) with a general convex constraint.
  We show that our algorithm achieves a sublinear regret of $O(nT^{4/5})$ (where $T$
  is the horizon and $n$ is the dimension) for any bounded convex functions with uniformly
  bounded gradients. We also evaluate the performance of our algorithm against baselines
  on both synthetic and real data sets for quadratic programming, portfolio selection
  and matrix completion problems.
