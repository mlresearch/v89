title: Differentially Private Online Submodular Minimization
abstract: In this paper we develop the first algorithms for online submodular minimization
  that preserve differential privacy under full information feedback and bandit feedback.  Our
  first result is in the full information setting, where the algorithm can observe
  the entire function after making its decision at each time step.  We give an algorithm
  in this setting that is $\eps$-differentially private and achieves expected regret
  $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{n\sqrt{T}}{\eps}\right)$ over $T$ rounds for a collection
  of $n$ elements.  Our second result is in the bandit setting, where the algorithm
  can only observe the cost incurred by its chosen set, and does not have access to
  the entire function.  This setting is significantly more challenging due to the
  limited information. Our algorithm using bandit feedback is $\eps$-differentially
  private and achieves expected regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{n^{3/2}T^{2/3}}{\eps}\right)$.
