title: Gaussian Process Modulated Cox Processes under Linear Inequality Constraints
abstract: Gaussian process (GP) modulated Cox processes are widely used to model point
  patterns. Existing approaches require a mapping (link function) between the unconstrained
  GP and the positive intensity function. This commonly yields solutions that do not
  have a closed form or that are restricted to specific covariance functions. We introduce
  a novel finite approximation of GP-modulated Cox processes where positiveness conditions
  can be imposed directly on the GP, with no restrictions on the covariance function.
  Our approach can also ensure other types of inequality constraints (e.g. monotonicity,
  convexity), resulting in more versatile models that can be used for other classes
  of point processes (e.g. renewal processes). We demonstrate on both synthetic and
  real-world data that our framework accurately infers the intensity functions. Where
  monotonicity is a feature of the process, our ability to include this in the inference
  improves results.
