title: Efficient Bayesian Experimental Design for Implicit Models
abstract: Bayesian experimental design involves the optimal allocation of resources
  in an experiment, with the aim of optimising cost and performance. For implicit
  models, where the likelihood is intractable but sampling from the model is possible,
  this task is particularly difficult and therefore largely unexplored. This is mainly
  due to technical difficulties associated with approximating posterior distributions
  and utility functions. We devise a novel experimental design framework for implicit
  models that improves upon previous work in two ways. First, we use the mutual information
  between parameters and data as the utility function, which has previously not been
  feasible. We achieve this by utilising Likelihood-Free Inference by Ratio Estimation
  (LFIRE) to approximate posterior distributions, instead of the traditional approximate
  Bayesian computation or synthetic likelihood methods. Secondly, we use Bayesian
  optimisation in order to solve the optimal design problem, as opposed to the typically
  used grid search or sampling-based methods. We find that this increases efficiency
  and allows us to consider higher design dimensions.
