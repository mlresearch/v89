title: Precision Matrix Estimation with Noisy and Missing Data
abstract: Estimating conditional dependence graphs and precision matrices are some
  of the most common problems in modern statistics and machine learning. When data
  are fully observed, penalized maximum likelihood-type estimators have become standard
  tools for estimating graphical models under sparsity conditions. Extensions of these
  methods to more complex settings where data are contaminated with additive or multiplicative
  noise have been developed in recent years. In these settings, however, the relative
  performance of different methods is not well understood and algorithmic gaps still
  exist. In particular, in high-dimensional settings these methods require using non-positive
  semidefinite matrices as inputs, presenting novel optimization challenges. We develop
  an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for these problems,
  providing a feasible algorithm to estimate precision matrices with indefinite input
  and potentially nonconvex penalties. We compare this method with existing alternative
  solutions and empirically characterize the tradeoffs between them. Finally, we use
  this method to explore the networks among US senators estimated from voting records
  data.
