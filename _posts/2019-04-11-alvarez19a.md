title: Non-linear process convolutions for multi-output Gaussian processes
abstract: The paper introduces a non-linear version of the process convolution formalism
  for building covariance functions for multi-output Gaussian processes. The non-linearity
  is introduced via Volterra series, one series per each output. We provide closed-form
  expressions for the mean function and the covariance function of the approximated
  Gaussian process at the output of the Volterra series. The mean function and covariance
  function for the joint Gaussian process are derived using formulae for the product
  moments of Gaussian variables. We compare the performance of the non-linear model
  against the classical process convolution approach in one synthetic dataset and
  two real datasets.
