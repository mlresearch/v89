title: Unsupervised Alignment of Embeddings with Wasserstein Procrustes
abstract: We consider the task of aligning two sets of points in high dimension, which
  has many applications in natural language processing and computer vision. As an
  example, it was recently shown that it is possible to infer a bilingual lexicon,
  without supervised data, by aligning word embeddings trained on monolingual data.
  These recent advances are based on adversarial training to learn the mapping between
  the two embeddings. In this paper, we propose to use an alternative formulation,
  based on the joint estimation of an orthogonal matrix and a permutation matrix.
  While this problem is not convex, we propose to initialize our optimization algorithm
  by using a convex relaxation, traditionally considered for the graph isomorphism
  problem. We propose a stochastic algorithm to minimize our cost function on large
  scale problems. Finally, we evaluate our method on the problem of unsupervised word
  translation, by aligning word embeddings trained on monolingual data. On this task,
  our method obtains state of the art results, while requiring less computational
  resources than competing approaches.
