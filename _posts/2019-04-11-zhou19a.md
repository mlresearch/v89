title: Faster First-Order Methods for Stochastic Non-Convex Optimization on Riemannian
  Manifolds
abstract: SPIDER (Stochastic Path Integrated Differential EstimatoR) is an efficient
  gradient estimation technique developed for non-convex stochastic optimization.
  Although having been shown to attain nearly optimal computational complexity bounds,
  the SPIDER-type methods are limited to linear metric spaces.  In this paper, we
  introduce the Riemannian SPIDER (R-SPIDER) method as a novel nonlinear-metric extension
  of SPIDER for efficient non-convex optimization on Riemannian manifolds. We prove
  that for finite-sum problems with $n$ components, R-SPIDER converges to an $\epsilon$-accuracy
  stationary point within $\mathcal{O}\big(\min\big(n+\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\epsilon^2},\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}\big)\big)$
  stochastic gradient evaluations, which is sharper in magnitude than the prior Riemannian
  first-order methods. For online optimization, R-SPIDER is shown to converge with
  $\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}\big)$ complexity which is, to the best of
  our knowledge, the first non-asymptotic result for online Riemannian optimization.
  Especially, for gradient dominated functions, we further develop a variant of R-SPIDER
  and prove its linear convergence rate. Numerical results demonstrate the computational
  efficiency of the proposed methods.
