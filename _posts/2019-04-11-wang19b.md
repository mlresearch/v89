title: Subsampled Renyi Differential Privacy and Analytical Moments Accountant
abstract: 'We study the problem of subsampling in differential privacy (DP), a question
  that is the centerpiece behind many successful differentially private machine learning
  algorithms.  Specifically, we provide a tight upper bound on the Renyi Differential
  Privacy (RDP) [Mironov 2017] parameters for algorithms that: (1) subsample the dataset,
  and then (2) applies a randomized mechanism M to the subsample, in terms of the
  RDP parameters of M and the subsampling probability parameter. Our results generalize
  the moments accounting technique, developed by [Abadi et al. 2016] for the Gaussian
  mechanism, to any subsampled RDP mechanism.'
