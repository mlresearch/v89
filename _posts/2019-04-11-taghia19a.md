title: Conditionally Independent Multiresolution Gaussian Processes
abstract: The multiresolution Gaussian process (GP) has gained increasing attention
  as a viable approach towards improving the quality of approximations in GPs that
  scale well to large-scale data. Most of the current constructions assume full independence
  across resolutions. This assumption simplifies the inference, but it underestimates
  the uncertainties in transitioning from one resolution to another. This in turn
  results in models which are prone to overfitting in the sense of excessive sensitivity
  to the chosen resolution, and predictions which are non-smooth at the boundaries.
  Our contribution is a new construction which instead assumes conditional independence
  among GPs across resolutions. We show that relaxing the full independence assumption
  enables robustness against overfitting, and that it delivers predictions that are
  smooth at the boundaries. Our new model is compared against current state of the
  art on 2 synthetic and 9 real-world datasets. In most cases, our new conditionally
  independent construction performed favorably when compared against models based
  on the full independence assumption. In particular, it exhibits little to no signs
  of overfitting.
