title: Differentiable Antithetic Sampling for Variance Reduction in Stochastic Variational
  Inference
abstract: Stochastic optimization techniques are standard in variational inference
  algorithms. These methods estimate gradients by approximating expectations with
  independent Monte Carlo samples. In this paper, we explore a technique that uses
  correlated, but more representative, samples to reduce estimator variance. Specifically,
  we show how to generate antithetic samples that match sample moments with the true
  moments of an underlying importance distribution. Combining a differentiable antithetic
  sampler with modern stochastic variational inference, we showcase the effectiveness
  of this approach for learning a deep generative model. An implementation is available
  at https://github.com/mhw32/antithetic-vae-public.
