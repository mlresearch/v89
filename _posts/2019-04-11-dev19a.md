title: Attenuating Bias in Word vectors
abstract: Word vector representations are well developed tools for various NLP and
  Machine Learning tasks and are known to retain significant semantic and syntactic
  structure of languages. But they are prone to carrying and amplifying bias which
  can perpetrate discrimination in various applications. In this work, we explore
  new simple ways to detect the most stereotypically gendered words in an embedding
  and remove the bias from them.  We verify how names are masked carriers of gender
  bias and then use that as a tool to attenuate bias in embeddings. Further, we extend
  this property of names to show how names can be used to detect other types of bias
  in the embeddings such as bias based on race, ethnicity, and age.
