title: Infinite Task Learning in RKHSs
abstract: Machine learning has witnessed tremendous success in solving tasks depending
  on a single hyperparameter. When considering simultaneously a finite number of tasks,
  multi-task learning enables one to account for the similarities of the tasks via
  appropriate regularizers. A step further consists of learning a continuum of tasks
  for various loss functions. A promising approach, called Parametric Task Learning,
  has paved the way in the continuum setting for affine models and piecewise-linear
  loss functions.  In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Infinite Task
  Learning whose goal is to learn a function whose output is a function over the hyperparameter
  space.  We leverage tools from operator-valued kernels and the associated vector-valued
  RKHSs that provide an explicit control over the role of the hyperparameters, and
  also allows us to consider new type of constraints. We provide generalization guarantees
  to the suggested scheme and illustrate its efficiency in cost-sensitive classification,
  quantile regression and density level set estimation.
