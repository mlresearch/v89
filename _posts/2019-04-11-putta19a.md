title: Exponential Weights on the Hypercube in Polynomial Time
abstract: We study a general online linear optimization problem(OLO). At each round,
  a subset of objects from a fixed universe of $n$ objects is chosen, and a linear
  cost associated with the chosen subset is incurred. To measure the performance of
  our algorithms, we use the notion of regret which is the difference between the
  total cost incurred over all iterations and the cost of the best fixed subset in
  hindsight. We consider Full Information and Bandit feedback for this problem. This
  problem is equivalent to OLO on the $\{0,1\}^n$ hypercube. The Exp2 algorithm and
  its bandit variant are commonly used strategies for this problem. It was previously
  unknown if it is possible to run Exp2 on the hypercube in polynomial time.  In this
  paper, we present a polynomial time algorithm called PolyExp for OLO on the hypercube.
  We show that our algorithm is equivalent Exp2 on $\{0,1\}^n$, Online Mirror Descent(OMD),
  Follow The Regularized Leader(FTRL) and Follow The Perturbed Leader(FTPL) algorithms.
  We show PolyExp achieves expected regret bound that is a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ better
  than Exp2 in the full information setting under $L_\infty$ adversarial losses. Because
  of the equivalence of these algorithms, this implies an improvement on Exp2â€™s regret
  bound in full information. We also show matching regret lower bounds. Finally, we
  show how to use PolyExp on the $\{-1,+1\}^n$ hypercube, solving an open problem
  in Bubeck et al (COLT 2012).
