title: Globally-convergent Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares for Robust Regression
  Problems
abstract: We provide the first global model recovery results for the IRLS (iteratively
  reweighted least squares) heuristic for robust regression problems. IRLS is known
  to offer excellent performance, despite bad initializations and data corruption,
  for several parameter estimation problems. Existing analyses of IRLS frequently
  require careful initialization, thus offering only local convergence guarantees.
  We remedy this by proposing augmentations to the basic IRLS routine that not only
  offer guaranteed global recovery, but in practice also outperform state-of-the-art
  algorithms for robust regression. Our routines are more immune to hyperparameter
  misspecification in basic regression tasks, as well as applied tasks such as linear-armed
  bandit problems. Our theoretical analyses rely on a novel extension of the notions
  of strong convexity and smoothness to weighted strong convexity and smoothness,
  and establishing that sub-Gaussian designs offer bounded weighted condition numbers.
  These notions may be useful in analyzing other algorithms as well.
