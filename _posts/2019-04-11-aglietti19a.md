title: Efficient Inference in Multi-task Cox Process Models
abstract: We generalize the log Gaussian Cox process (LGCP) framework to model multiple
  correlated point data jointly. The observations are treated as realizations of multiple
  LGCPs, whose log intensities are given by linear combinations of latent functions
  drawn from Gaussian process priors. The combination coefficients are also drawn
  from Gaussian processes and can incorporate additional dependencies. We derive closed-form
  expressions for the moments of the intensity functions and develop an efficient
  variational inference algorithm that is orders of magnitude faster than competing
  deterministic and stochastic approximations of multivariate LGCPs, coregionalization
  models, and multi-task permanental processes. Our approach  outperforms these benchmarks
  in multiple problems, offering the current state of the art in modeling multivariate
  point processes.
