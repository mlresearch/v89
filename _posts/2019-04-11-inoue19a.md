title: Adaptive Ensemble Prediction for Deep Neural Networks based on Confidence Level
abstract: Ensembling multiple predictions is a widely used technique for improving
  the accuracy of various machine learning tasks. One obvious drawback of ensembling
  is its higher execution cost during inference. In this paper, we first describe
  our insights on the relationship between the probability of prediction and the effect
  of ensembling with current deep neural networks; ensembling does not help mispredictions
  for inputs predicted with a high probability even when there is a non-negligible
  number of mispredicted inputs. This finding motivated us to develop a way to adaptively
  control the ensembling. If the prediction for an input reaches a high enough probability,
  i.e., the output from the softmax function, on the basis of the confidence level,
  we stop ensembling for this input to avoid wasting computation power. We evaluated
  the adaptive ensembling by using various datasets and showed that it reduces the
  computation cost significantly while achieving accuracy similar to that of static
  ensembling using a pre-defined number of local predictions. We also show that our
  statistically rigorous confidence-level-based early-exit condition reduces the burden
  of task-dependent threshold tuning better compared with naive early exit based on
  a pre-defined threshold in addition to yielding a better accuracy with the same
  cost.
