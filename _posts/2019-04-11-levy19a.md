title: Projection Free Online Learning over Smooth Sets
abstract: The projection operation is a crucial step in applying Online Gradient Descent
  (OGD) and its stochastic version SGD. Unfortunately, in some cases, projection is
  computationally demanding and inhibits us from applying OGD.  In this work we focus
  on the special case where the constraint set is smooth and we have an access to  gradient
  and value oracles  of the constraint function. Under these assumptions we design
  a new  approximate projection operation that necessitates only logarithmically many
  calls to these oracles. We further show that combining OGD with this new approximate
  projection, results in a projection free variant which recovers the standard rates
  of the fully projected version. This applies to both convex and strongly-convex
  online settings.
