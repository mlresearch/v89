title: 'Extreme Stochastic Variational Inference: Distributed Inference for Large
  Scale Mixture Models'
abstract: Mixture of exponential family models are among the most fundamental and
  widely used statistical models. Stochastic variational inference (SVI), the state-of-the-art
  algorithm for parameter estimation in such models is inherently serial. Moreover,
  it requires the parameters to fit in the memory of a single processor; this poses
  serious limitations on scalability when the number of parameters is in billions.
  In this paper, we present extreme stochastic variational inference (ESVI), a distributed,
  asynchronous and lock-free algorithm to perform variational inference for mixture
  models on massive real world datasets. ESVI overcomes the limitations of SVI by
  requiring that each processor only access a subset of the data and a subset of the
  parameters, thus providing data and model parallelism simultaneously. Our empirical
  study demonstrates that ESVI not only outperforms VI and SVI in wallclock-time,
  but also achieves a better quality solution. To further speed up computation and
  save memory when fitting large number of topics, we propose a variant ESVI-TOPK
  which maintains only the top-k important topics. Empirically, we found that using
  top 25% topics suffices to achieve the same accuracy as storing all the topics.
