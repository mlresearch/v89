title: Testing Conditional Independence on Discrete Data using Stochastic Complexity
abstract: Testing for conditional independence is a core aspect of constraint-based
  causal discovery. Although commonly used tests are perfect in theory, they often
  fail to reject independence in practice—especially when conditioning on multiple
  variables.  We focus on discrete data and propose a new test based on the notion
  of algorithmic independence that we instantiate using stochastic complexity. Amongst
  others, we show that our proposed test, SCI, is an asymptotically unbiased as well
  as L2 consistent estimator for conditional mutual information (CMI).  Further, we
  show that SCI can be reformulated to find a sensible threshold for CMI that works
  well on limited samples. Empirical evaluation shows that SCI has a lower type II
  error than commonly used tests. As a result, we obtain a higher recall when we use
  SCI in causal discovery algorithms, without compromising the precision.
