title: Linear Convergence of the Primal-Dual Gradient Method for Convex-Concave Saddle
  Point Problems without Strong Convexity
abstract: We consider the convex-concave saddle point problem $\min_{x}\max_{y} f(x)+y^\top
  A x-g(y)$ where $f$ is smooth and convex and $g$ is smooth and strongly convex.
  We prove that if the coupling matrix $A$ has full column rank, the vanilla primal-dual
  gradient method can achieve linear convergence even if $f$ is not strongly convex.
  Our result generalizes previous work which either requires $f$ and $g$ to be quadratic
  functions or requires proximal mappings for both $f$ and $g$. We adopt a novel analysis
  technique that in each iteration uses a "ghost" update as a reference, and show
  that the iterates in the primal-dual gradient method converge to this "ghost" sequence.
  Using the same technique we further give an analysis for the primal-dual stochastic
  variance reduced gradient method for convex-concave saddle point problems with a
  finite-sum structure.
