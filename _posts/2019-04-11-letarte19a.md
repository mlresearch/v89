title: Pseudo-Bayesian Learning with Kernel Fourier Transform as Prior
abstract: 'We revisit Rahimi and Recht (2007)’s kernel random Fourier features (RFF)
  method through the lens of the PAC-Bayesian theory. While the primary goal of RFF
  is to approximate a kernel, we look at the Fourier transform as a prior distribution
  over trigonometric hypotheses. It naturally suggests learning a posterior on these
  hypotheses. We derive generalization bounds that are optimized by learning a pseudo-posterior
  obtained from a closed-form expression. Based on this study, we consider two learning
  strategies: The first one finds a compact landmarks-based representation of the
  data where each landmark is given by a distribution-tailored similarity measure,
  while the second one provides a PAC-Bayesian justification to the kernel alignment
  method of Sinha and Duchi (2016).'
