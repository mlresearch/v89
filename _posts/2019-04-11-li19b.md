title: On Target Shift in Adversarial Domain Adaptation
abstract: Discrepancy between training and testing domains is a fundamental problem
  in the generalization of machine learning techniques. Recently, several approaches
  have been proposed to learn domain invariant feature representations through adversarial
  deep learning.  However, label shift, where the percentage of data in each class
  is different between domains, has received less attention. Label shift naturally
  arises in many contexts, especially in behavioral studies where the behaviors are
  freely chosen.  In this work, we propose a method called Domain Adversarial nets
  for Target Shift (DATS) to address label shift while learning a domain invariant
  representation. This is accomplished by using distribution matching to estimate
  label proportions in a blind test set. We extend this framework to handle multiple
  domains by developing a scheme to upweight source domains most similar to the target
  domain. Empirical results show that this framework performs well under large label
  shift in synthetic and real experiments, demonstrating the practical importance.
