title: Learning Tree Structures from Noisy Data
abstract: 'We provide high-probability sample complexity guarantees for exact structure
  recovery of tree-structured graphical models, when only noisy observations of the
  respective vertex emissions are available. We assume that the hidden variables follow
  either an Ising model or a Gaussian graphical model, and the observables are noise-corrupted
  versions of the hidden variables: We consider multiplicative $\pm 1$ binary noise
  for Ising models, and additive Gaussian noise for Gaussian models. Such hidden models
  arise naturally in a variety of applications such as physics, biology, computer
  science, and finance. We study the impact of measurement noise on the task of learning
  the underlying tree structure via the well-known \textit{Chow-Liu algorithm} and
  provide formal sample complexity guarantees for exact recovery. In particular, for
  a tree with $p$ vertices and probability of failure $\delta>0$, we show that the
  number of necessary samples for exact structure recovery is of the order of $\mc{O}(\log(p/\delta))$
  for Ising models (which remains the \textit{same as in the noiseless case}), and
  $\mc{O}(\mathrm{polylog}{(p/\delta)})$ for Gaussian models.'
