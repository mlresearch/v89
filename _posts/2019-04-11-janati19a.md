title: Wasserstein regularization for sparse multi-task regression
abstract: We focus in this paper on high-dimensional regression problems where each
  regressor can be associated to a location in a physical space, or more generally
  a generic geometric space. Such problems often employ sparse priors, which promote
  models using a small subset of regressors. To increase statistical power, the so-called
  multi-task techniques were proposed, which consist in the simultaneous estimation
  of several related models. Combined with sparsity assumptions, it lead to models
  enforcing the active regressors to be shared across models, thanks to, for instance
  L1/Lq norms. We argue in this paper that these techniques fail to leverage the spatial
  information associated to regressors. Indeed, while sparse priors enforce that only
  a small subset of variables is used, the assumption that these regressors overlap
  across all tasks is overly simplistic given the spatial variability observed in
  real data. In this paper, we propose a convex regularizer for multi-task regression
  that encodes a more flexible geometry. Our regularizer is based on unbalanced optimal
  transport (OT) theory, and can take into account a prior geometric knowledge on
  the regressor variables, without necessarily requiring overlapping supports. We
  derive an efficient algorithm based on a regularized formulation of OT, which iterates
  through applications of Sinkhornâ€™s algorithm along with coordinate descent iterations.
  The performance of our model is demonstrated on regular grids with both synthetic
  and real datasets as well as complex triangulated geometries of the cortex with
  an application in neuroimaging.
