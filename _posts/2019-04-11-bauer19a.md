title: Resampled Priors for Variational Autoencoders
abstract: We propose Learned Accept/Reject Sampling (LARS), a method for constructing
  richer priors using rejection sampling with a learned acceptance function. This
  work is motivated by recent analyses of the VAE objective, which pointed out that
  commonly used simple priors can lead to underfitting. As the distribution induced
  by LARS involves an intractable normalizing constant, we show how to estimate it
  and its gradients efficiently. We demonstrate that LARS priors improve VAE performance
  on several standard datasets both when they are learned jointly with the rest of
  the model and when they are fitted to a pretrained model. Finally, we show that
  LARS can be combined with existing methods for defining flexible priors for an additional
  boost in performance.
