title: An Optimal Algorithm for Stochastic Three-Composite Optimization
abstract: We develop an optimal primal-dual first-order algorithm for a class of stochastic
  three-composite convex minimization problems. The convergence rate of our method
  not only improves upon the existing methods, but also matches a lower bound derived
  for all first-order methods that solve this problem. We extend our proposed algorithm
  to solve a composite stochastic   program with any finite number of nonsmooth functions.
  In addition, we generalize an optimal stochastic alternating direction method of
  multipliers (SADMM) algorithm proposed for the two-composite case to solve this
  problem, and establish its connection to our optimal primal-dual algorithm. We perform
  extensive numerical experiments on a variety of machine learning applications to
  demonstrate the superiority of our method via-a-vis the state-of-the-art.
