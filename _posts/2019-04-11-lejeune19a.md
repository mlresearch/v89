title: Adaptive Estimation for Approximate $k$-Nearest-Neighbor Computations
abstract: Algorithms often carry out equally many computations for "easy" and "hard"
  problem instances. In particular, algorithms for finding nearest neighbors typically
  have the same running time regardless of the particular problem instance.  In this
  paper, we consider the approximate $k$-nearest-neighbor problem, which is the problem
  of finding a subset of O(k) points in a given set of points that contains the set
  of $k$ nearest neighbors of a given query point. We propose an algorithm based on
  adaptively estimating the distances, and show that it is essentially optimal out
  of algorithms that are only allowed to adaptively estimate distances. We then demonstrate
  both theoretically and experimentally that the algorithm can achieve significant
  speedups relative to the naive method.
