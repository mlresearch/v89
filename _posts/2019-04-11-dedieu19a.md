title: Error bounds for sparse classifiers in high-dimensions
abstract: 'We prove an L2 recovery bound for a family of sparse estimators defined
  as minimizers of some empirical loss functions – which include hinge loss and logistic
  loss. More precisely, we achieve an upper-bound for coefficients estimation scaling
  as $(k\ast/n)\log(p/k\ast)$: n,p is the size of the design matrix and k* the dimension
  of the theoretical loss minimizer. This is done under standard assumptions, for
  which we derive stronger versions of a cone condition and a restricted strong convexity.
  Our bound holds with high probability and in expectation and applies to an L1-regularized
  estimator and to a recently introduced Slope estimator, which we generalize for
  classification problems.  Slope presents the advantage of adapting to unknown sparsity.
  Thus, we propose a tractable proximal algorithm to compute it and assess its empirical
  performance. Our results match the best existing bounds for classification and regression
  problems.'
