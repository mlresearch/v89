title: Bridging the gap between regret minimization and best arm identification, with
  application to A/B tests
abstract: State of the art online learning procedures focus  either on selecting the
  best alternative (“best arm identification”) or on minimizing the cost (the “regret”).
  We merge these two objectives by providing the theoretical analysis of cost minimizing
  algorithms that are also $\delta$-PAC (with a proven guaranteed bound on the decision
  time), hence fulfilling at the same time regret minimization and best arm identification.
  This analysis sheds light on the common observation that ill-callibrated UCB-algorithms
  minimize regret while still identifying quickly the best arm.  We also extend these
  results to the non-iid case faced by many practitioners. This provides a technique
  to make cost versus decision time compromise when doing adaptive tests with applications
  ranging from website A/B testing to clinical trials.
