title: "$β^3$-IRT: A New Item Response Model and its Applications"
abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) aims to assess latent abilities of respondents
  based on the correctness of their answers in aptitude test items with different
  difficulty levels.  In this paper, we propose the $\beta^3$-IRT model, which models
  continuous responses and can generate a much enriched family of Item Characteristic
  Curves. In experiments we applied the proposed model to data from an online exam
  platform, and show our model outperforms a more standard 2PL-ND model on all datasets.
  Furthermore, we show how to apply  $\beta^3$-IRT to assess the ability of machine
  learning classifiers.This novel application results in a new metric for evaluating
  the quality of the classifier’s probability estimates, based on the inferred difficulty
  and discrimination of data instances.
