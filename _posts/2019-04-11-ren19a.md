title: Exploring $k$ out of Top $ρ$ Fraction of Arms in Stochastic Bandits
abstract: 'This paper studies the problem of identifying any $k$ distinct arms among
  the top $\rho$ fraction (e.g., top 5%) of arms from a finite or infinite set with
  a probably approximately correct (PAC) tolerance $\epsilon$. We consider two cases:
  (i) when the threshold of the top arms’ expected rewards is known and (ii) when
  it is unknown. We prove lower bounds for the four variants (finite or infinite arms,
  and known or unknown threshold), and propose algorithms for each. Two of these algorithms
  are shown to be sample complexity optimal (up to constant factors) and the other
  two are optimal up to a log factor. Results in this paper provide up to $\rho n/k$
  reductions compared with the “$k$-exploration” algorithms that focus on finding
  the (PAC) best $k$ arms out of $n$ arms. We also numerically show improvements over
  the state-of-the-art.'
