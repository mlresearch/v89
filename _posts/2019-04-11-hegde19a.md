title: Deep learning with differential Gaussian process flows
abstract: We propose a novel deep learning paradigm of differential flows that learn
  a stochastic differential equation transformations of inputs prior to a standard
  classification or regression function. The key property of differential Gaussian
  processes is the warping of inputs through infinitely deep, but infinitesimal, differential
  fields, that generalise discrete layers into a dynamical system. We demonstrate
  excellent results as compared to deep Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks.
