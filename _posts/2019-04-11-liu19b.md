title: Generalized Boltzmann Machine with Deep Neural Structure
abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an essential component in many machine
  learning applications. As a probabilistic graphical model, RBM posits a shallow
  structure, which makes it less capable of modeling real-world applications. In this
  paper, to bridge the gap between RBM and artificial neural network, we propose an
  energy-based probabilistic model that is more flexible on modeling continuous data.
  By introducing the pair-wise inverse autoregressive flow into RBM, we propose two
  generalized continuous RBMs which contain deep neural network structure to more
  flexibly track the practical data distribution while still keeping the inference
  tractable. In addition, we extend the generalized RBM structures into sequential
  setting to better model the stochastic process of time series. Performance improvements
  on probabilistic modeling and representation learning are demonstrated by the experiments
  on diverse datasets.
