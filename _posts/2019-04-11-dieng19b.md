title: Interpretable Almost-Exact Matching for Causal Inference
abstract: Matching methods are heavily used in the social and health sciences due
  to their interpretability. We aim to create the highest possible quality of treatment-control
  matches for categorical data in the potential outcomes framework. The method proposed
  in this work aims to match units on a weighted Hamming distance, taking into account
  the relative importance of the covariates; the algorithm aims to match units on
  as many relevant variables as possible. To do this, the algorithm creates a hierarchy
  of covariate combinations on which to match (similar to downward closure), in the
  process solving an optimization problem for each unit in order to construct the
  optimal matches. The algorithm uses a single dynamic program to solve all of the
  unitsâ€™ optimization problems simultaneously. Notable advantages of our method over
  existing matching procedures are its high-quality interpretable matches, versatility
  in handling different data distributions that may have irrelevant variables, and
  ability to handle missing data by matching on as many available covariates as possible.
