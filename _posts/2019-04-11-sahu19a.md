title: Towards Gradient Free and Projection Free Stochastic Optimization
abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of \emph{constrained} \emph{stochastic}
  optimization. A zeroth order Frank-Wolfe algorithm is proposed, which in addition
  to the projection-free nature of the vanilla Frank-Wolfe algorithm makes it gradient
  free. Under convexity and smoothness assumption, we show that the proposed algorithm
  converges to the optimal objective function at a rate $O\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$,
  where $T$ denotes the iteration count. In particular, the primal sub-optimality
  gap is shown to have a dimension dependence of $O\left(d^{1/3}\right)$, which is
  the best known dimension dependence among all zeroth order optimization algorithms
  with one directional derivative per iteration. For non-convex functions, we obtain
  the \emph{Frank-Wolfe} gap to be $O\left(d^{1/3}T^{-1/4}\right)$. Experiments on
  black-box optimization setups demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.
