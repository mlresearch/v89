title: Near Optimal Algorithms for Hard Submodular Programs with Discounted Cooperative
  Costs
abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of submodular problems which in general
  are very hard. These include minimizing a submodular cost function under combinatorial
  constraints, which include cuts, matchings, paths, etc., optimizing a submodular
  function under submodular cover and submodular knapsack constraints, and minimizing
  a ratio of submodular functions. All these problems appear in several real world
  problems but have hardness factors of   $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for general submodular
  cost functions. We show   how we can achieve constant approximation factors when
  we restrict   the cost functions to low rank sums of concave over modular   functions.
  A wide variety of machine learning applications are very naturally modeled via this
  subclass of submodular functions. Our work therefore provides a tighter connection
  between theory and practice by enabling theoretically satisfying   guarantees for
  a rich class of expressible, natural, and useful submodular   cost models. We empirically
  demonstrate the utility of our models on   real world problems of cooperative image
  matching and sensor   placement with cooperative costs.
