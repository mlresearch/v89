title: Active multiple matrix completion with adaptive confidence sets
abstract: We address the problem of an active setting for a matrix completion, where
  the learner can choose, from which matrix, it  receives a sample (drawn uniformly
  at random). Our main practical motivation is the  market segmentation, where the
  matrices are different regions with different preferences of the customers. The
  challenge in this setting is that each of the matrices can be of a different size
  and also of a different rank. We provide and analyze a new algorithm, MAlocate that
  is able to adapt to the ranks of the different matrices. We also prove a lower-bound
  showing that our strategy is minimax-optimal, and we demonstrate its performance
  with synthetic experiments.
