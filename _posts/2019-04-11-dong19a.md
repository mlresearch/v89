title: Blind Demixing via Wirtinger Flow with Random Initialization
abstract: This paper concerns the problem of demixing a series of source signals from
  the sum of bilinear measurements. This problem spans diverse areas such as communication,
  imaging processing, machine learning, etc. However, semidefinite programming for
  blind demixing is prohibitive to large-scale problems due to high computational
  complexity and storage cost. Although several efficient algorithms have been developed
  recently that enjoy the benefits of fast convergence rates and even regularization
  free, they still call for spectral initialization. To find simple initialization
  approach that works equally well as spectral initialization, we propose to solve
  blind demixing problem via Wirtinger flow with random initialization, which yields
  a natural implementation. To reveal the efficiency of this algorithm, we provide
  the global convergence guarantee concerning randomly initialized Wirtinger flow
  for blind demixing. Specifically, it shows that with sufficient samples, the iterates
  of randomly initialized Wirtinger flow can enter a local region that enjoys strong
  convexity and strong smoothness within a few iterations at the first stage. At the
  second stage, iterates of randomly initialized Wirtinger flow further converge linearly
  to the ground truth.
