title: Adversarial Variational Optimization of Non-Differentiable Simulators
abstract: Complex computer simulators are increasingly used across fields of science
  as generative models tying parameters of an underlying theory to experimental observations.
  Inference in this setup is often difficult, as simulators rarely admit a tractable
  density or likelihood function. We introduce Adversarial Variational Optimization
  (AVO), a likelihood-free inference algorithm for fitting a non-differentiable generative
  model incorporating ideas from generative adversarial networks, variational optimization
  and empirical Bayes. We adapt the training procedure of generative adversarial networks
  by replacing the differentiable generative network with a domain-specific simulator.
  We solve the resulting non-differentiable minimax problem by minimizing variational
  upper bounds of the two adversarial objectives. Effectively, the procedure results
  in learning a proposal distribution over simulator parameters, such that the JS
  divergence between the marginal distribution of the synthetic data and the empirical
  distribution of observed data is minimized. We evaluate and compare the method with
  simulators producing both discrete and continuous data.
