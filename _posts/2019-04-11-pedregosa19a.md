title: Proximal Splitting Meets Variance Reduction
abstract: Despite the raise to fame of stochastic variance reduced methods like SAGA
  and ProxSVRG, their use in non-smooth optimization is still limited to a few simple
  cases. Existing methods require to compute the proximal operator of the non-smooth
  term at each iteration, which, for complex penalties like the total variation, overlapping
  group lasso or trend filtering, is an iterative process that becomes unfeasible
  for moderately large problems. In this work we propose and analyze VRTOS, a variance-reduced
  method to solve problems with an arbitrary number of non-smooth terms. Like other
  variance reduced methods, it only requires to evaluate one gradient per iteration
  and converges with a constant step size, and so is ideally suited for large scale
  applications. Unlike existing variance reduced methods, it admits multiple non-smooth
  terms whose proximal operator only needs to be evaluated once per iteration. We
  provide a convergence rate analysis for the proposed methods that achieves the same
  asymptotic rate as their full gradient variants and illustrate its computational
  advantage on 4 different large scale datasets.
