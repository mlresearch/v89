title: Robustness Guarantees for Density Clustering
abstract: Despite the practical relevance of density-based clustering algorithms,
  there is little understanding in its statistical robustness properties under possibly
  adversarial contamination of the input data. We show both robustness and consistency
  guarantees for a simple modification of the popular DBSCAN algorithm. We then give
  experimental results which suggest that this method may be relevant in practice.
