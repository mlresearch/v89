title: Scalable High-Order Gaussian Process Regression
abstract: While most Gaussian processes (GP) work focus on learning single-output
  functions, many applications, such as physical simulations and gene expressions
  prediction, require estimations of functions with many outputs. The number of outputs
  can be much larger than or comparable to the size of training samples. Existing
  multi-output GP models either are limited to low-dimensional outputs and restricted
  kernel choices,  or assume oversimplified low-rank structures within the outputs.
  To address these issues, we propose HOGPR, a High-Order Gaussian Process Regression
  model, which can flexibly capture complex correlations among the outputs and scale
  up to a large number of outputs. Specifically, we tensorize the high-dimensional
  outputs, introducing latent coordinate features to index each tensor element (i.e.,
  output) and to capture their correlations. We then generalize a multilinear model
  to a hybrid of a GP and latent GP model. The model is endowed with a Kronecker product
  structure over the inputs and the latent features. Using the Kronecker product properties
  and tensor algebra, we are able to perform exact inference over millions of outputs.
  We show the advantage of the proposed model on several real-world applications.
