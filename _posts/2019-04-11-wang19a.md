title: Computation Efficient Coded Linear Transform
abstract: In large-scale distributed linear transform problems, coded computation
  plays an important role to reduce the delay caused by slow machines. However, existing
  coded schemes could end up destroying the significant sparsity that exists in large-scale
  machine learning problems, and in turn increase the computational delay. In this
  paper, we propose a coded computation strategy, referred to as diagonal code, that
  achieves the optimum recovery threshold and the optimum computation load. Furthermore,
  by leveraging the ideas from random proposal graph theory, we design a random code
  that achieves a constant computation load, which significantly outperforms the existing
  best known result. We apply our schemes to the distributed gradient descent problem
  and demonstrate the advantage of the approach over current fastest coded schemes.
