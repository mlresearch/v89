title: The Termination Critic
abstract: 'In this work, we consider the problem of autonomously discovering behavioral
  abstractions, or options, for reinforcement learning agents. We propose an algorithm
  that focuses on the termination function, as opposed to  - as is common - the policy.
  The termination function is usually trained to optimize a control objective: an
  option ought to terminate if another has better value. We offer a different, information-theoretic
  perspective, and propose that terminations should focus instead on the compressibility
  of the optionâ€™s encoding - arguably a key reason for using abstractions. To achieve
  this algorithmically, we leverage the classical options framework, and learn the
  option transition model as a "critic" for the termination function. Using this model,
  we derive gradients that optimize the desired criteria. We show that the resulting
  options are non-trivial, intuitively meaningful, and useful for learning.'
