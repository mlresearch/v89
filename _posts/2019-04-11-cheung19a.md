title: A Thompson Sampling Algorithm for Cascading Bandits
abstract: We design and analyze TS-Cascade, a Thompson sampling algorithm for the
  cascading bandit problem. In TS-Cascade, Bayesian estimates of the click probability
  are constructed using a univariate Gaussian; this leads to a more efficient exploration
  procedure vis-ã-vis existing UCB-based approaches. We also incorporate the empirical
  variance of each item’s click probability into the Bayesian updates. These two novel
  features allow us to prove an expected regret bound of the form $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KLT})$
  where $L$ and $K$ are the number of ground items and the number of items in the
  chosen list respectively and $T\ge L$ is the number of Thompson sampling update
  steps. This matches the state-of-the-art regret bounds for UCB-based algorithms.
  More importantly, it is the first theoretical guarantee on a Thompson sampling algorithm
  for any stochastic combinatorial bandit problem model with partial feedback.  Empirical
  experiments demonstrate superiority of TS-Cascade compared to existing UCB-based
  procedures in terms of the expected cumulative regret and the time complexity.
