title: Revisiting Adversarial Risk
abstract: Recent works on adversarial perturbations show that there is an inherent
  trade-off between standard test accuracy and adversarial accuracy. Specifically,
  they show that no classifier can simultaneously be robust to adversarial perturbations
  and  achieve high standard test accuracy. However, this is contrary to the standard
  notion that on tasks such as image classification, humans are robust classifiers
  with low error rate. In this work, we show that the main reason behind this confusion
  is the inaccurate definition of adversarial perturbation that is used in the literature.  To
  fix this issue, we propose a slight, yet important modification to the existing
  definition of adversarial perturbation.  Based on the modified definition, we show
  that there is no trade-off between adversarial and standard accuracies; there exist
  classifiers that are robust and achieve high standard accuracy. We further study
  several properties of this new definition of adversarial risk and its relation to
  the existing definition.
