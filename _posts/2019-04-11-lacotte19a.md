title: Risk-Sensitive Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
abstract: We study risk-sensitive imitation learning where the agentâ€™s goal is to
  perform at least as well as the expert in terms of a risk profile. We first formulate
  our risk-sensitive imitation learning setting. We consider the generative adversarial
  approach to imitation learning (GAIL) and derive an optimization problem for our
  formulation, which we call it risk- sensitive GAIL (RS-GAIL). We then derive two
  different versions of our RS-GAIL optimization problem that aim at matching the
  risk profiles of the agent and the expert w.r.t. Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence
  and Wasserstein distance, and develop risk-sensitive generative adversarial imitation
  learning algorithms based on these optimization problems. We evaluate the performance
  of our algorithms and compare them with GAIL and the risk-averse imitation learning
  (RAIL) algorithms in two MuJoCo and two OpenAI classical control tasks.
