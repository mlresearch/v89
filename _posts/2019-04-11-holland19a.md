title: Robust descent using smoothed multiplicative noise
abstract: In this work, we propose a novel robust gradient descent procedure which
  makes use of a smoothed multiplicative noise applied directly to observations before
  constructing a sum of soft-truncated gradient coordinates. We show that the procedure
  has competitive theoretical guarantees, with the major advantage of a simple implementation
  that does not require an iterative sub-routine for robustification. Empirical tests
  reinforce the theory, showing more efficient generalization over a much wider class
  of data distributions.
