title: Bayesian Learning of Neural Network Architectures
abstract: In this paper we propose a Bayesian method for estimating architectural
  parameters of neural networks, namely layer size and network depth. We do this by
  learning concrete distributions over these parameters. Our results show that regular
  networks with a learned structure can generalise better on small datasets, while
  fully stochastic networks can be more robust to parameter initialisation. The proposed
  method relies on standard neural variational learning and, unlike randomised architecture
  search, does not require a retraining of the model, thus keeping the computational
  overhead at minimum.
