title: Lifted Weight Learning of Markov Logic Networks Revisited
abstract: We study lifted weight learning of Markov logic networks. We show that there
  is an algorithm for maximum-likelihood learning of 2-variable Markov logic networks
  which runs in time polynomial in the domain size. Our results are based on existing
  lifted-inference algorithms and recent algorithmic results on computing maximum
  entropy distributions.
