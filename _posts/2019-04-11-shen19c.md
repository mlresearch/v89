title: Harmonizable mixture kernels with variational Fourier features
abstract: The expressive power of Gaussian processes depends heavily on the choice
  of kernel. In this work we propose the novel harmonizable mixture kernel (HMK),
  a family of expressive, interpretable, non-stationary kernels derived from mixture
  models on the generalized spectral representation. As a theoretically sound treatment
  of non-stationary kernels, HMK supports harmonizable covariances, a wide subset
  of kernels including all stationary and many non-stationary covariances. We also
  propose variational Fourier features, an inter-domain sparse GP inference framework
  that offers a representative set of ’inducing frequencies’. We show that harmonizable
  mixture kernels interpolate between local patterns, and that variational Fourier
  features offers a robust kernel learning framework for the new kernel family.
