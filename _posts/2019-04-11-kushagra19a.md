title: Semi-supervised clustering for de-duplication
abstract: Data de-duplication is the task of detecting multiple records in a database
  that correspond to the same real-world entity. In this work, we view de-duplication
  as a clustering problem where the goal is to put records corresponding to the same
  physical entity in the same cluster and putting records corresponding to different
  physical entities into different clusters.  We introduce a framework which we call
  promise correlation clustering. Given a complete graph G with the edges labelled
  0 and 1, the goal is to find a clustering that minimizes the number of 0 edges within
  a cluster plus the number of 1 edges across different clusters (or correlation loss).
  The optimal clustering can also be viewed as a complete graph $G^*$ with edges corresponding
  to points in the same cluster being labelled 0 and other edges being labelled 1.
  Under the promise that the edge difference between G and $G^*$ is â€œsmall", we prove
  that finding the optimal clustering (or $G^*$) is still NP-Hard. \cite{ashtiani2016clustering}
  introduced the framework of semi-supervised clustering, where the learning algorithm
  has access to an oracle, which answers whether two points belong to the same or
  different clusters. We further prove that even with access to a same-cluster oracle,
  the promise version is NP-Hard as long as the number queries to the oracle is not
  too large (o(n) where n is the number of vertices).   Given these negative results,
  we consider a restricted version of correlation clustering. As before, the goal
  is to find a clustering that minimizes the correlation loss. However, we restrict
  ourselves to a given class F of clusterings. We offer a semi-supervised algorithmic
  approach to solve the restricted variant with success guarantees.
