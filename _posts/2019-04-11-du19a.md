title: Interaction Detection with Bayesian Decision Tree Ensembles
abstract: Methods based on Bayesian decision tree ensembles have proven valuable in
  constructing high-quality predictions, and are particularly attractive in certain
  settings because they encourage low-order interaction effects. Despite adapting
  to the presence of low-order interactions for prediction purpose, we show that Bayesian
  decision tree ensembles are generally anti-conservative for the purpose of conducting
  interaction detection. We address this problem by introducing Dirichlet process
  forests (DP-Forests), which leverage the presence of low-order interactions by clustering
  the trees so that trees within the same cluster focus on detecting a specific interaction.
  We show on both simulated and benchmark data that DP-Forests perform well relative
  to existing interaction detection techniques for detecting low-order interactions,
  attaining very low false-positive and false-negative rates while maintaining the
  same performance for prediction using a comparable computational budget.
