title: Distributional reinforcement learning with linear function approximation
abstract: Despite many algorithmic advances, our theoretical understanding of practical
  distributional reinforcement learning methods remains limited. One exception is
  Rowland et al. (2018)’s analysis of the C51 algorithm in terms of the Cramer distance,
  but their results only apply to the tabular setting and ignore C51’s use of a softmax
  to produce normalized distributions. In this paper we adapt the Cramer distance
  to deal with arbitrary vectors. From it we derive a new distributional algorithm
  which is fully Cramer-based and can be combined to linear function approximation,
  with formal guarantees in the context of policy evaluation. In allowing the model’s
  prediction to be any real vector, we lose the probabilistic interpretation behind
  the method, but otherwise maintain the appealing properties of distributional approaches.
  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first proof of convergence of a distributional
  algorithm combined with function approximation. Perhaps surprisingly, our results
  provide evidence that Cramer-based distributional methods may perform worse than
  directly approximating the value function.
