title: Orthogonal Estimation of Wasserstein Distances
abstract: Wasserstein distances are increasingly used in a wide variety of applications
  in machine learning. Sliced Wasserstein distances form an important subclass which
  may be estimated efficiently through one-dimensional sorting operations. In this
  paper, we propose a new variant of sliced Wasserstein distance, study the use of
  orthogonal coupling in Monte Carlo estimation of Wasserstein distances and draw
  connections with stratified sampling, and evaluate our approaches experimentally
  in a range of large-scale experiments in generative modelling and reinforcement
  learning.
