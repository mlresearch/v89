title: Large-Margin Classification in Hyperbolic Space
abstract: Representing data in hyperbolic space can effectively capture latent hierarchical
  relationships. To enable accurate classification of points in hyperbolic space while
  respecting their hyperbolic geometry, we introduce hyperbolic SVM, a hyperbolic
  formulation of support vector machine classifiers, and describe its theoretical
  connection to the Euclidean counterpart. We also generalize Euclidean kernel SVM
  to hyperbolic space, allowing nonlinear hyperbolic decision boundaries and providing
  a geometric interpretation for a certain class of indefinite kernels. Hyperbolic
  SVM improves classification accuracy in simulation and in real-world problems involving
  complex networks and word embeddings. Our work enables end-to-end analyses based
  on the inherent hyperbolic geometry of the data without resorting to ill-fitting
  tools developed for Euclidean space.
