title: Model Consistency for Learning with Mirror-Stratifiable Regularizers
abstract: Low-complexity non-smooth convex regularizers are routinely used to impose
  some structure (such as sparsity or low-rank) on the coefficients for linear predictors
  in supervised learning. Model consistency consists then in selecting the correct
  structure (for instance support or rank) by regularized empirical risk minimization.
  It is known that model consistency holds under appropriate non-degeneracy conditions.
  However such conditions typically fail for highly correlated designs and it is observed
  that regularization methods tend to select larger models. In this work, we provide
  the theoretical underpinning of this behavior using the notion of mirror-stratifiable
  regularizers. This class of regularizers encompasses the most well-known in the
  literature, including the L1 or trace norms. It brings into play a pair of primal-dual
  models, which in turn allows one to locate the structure of the solution using a
  specific dual certificate. We also show how this analysis is applicable to optimal
  solutions of the learning problem, and also to the iterates computed by a certain
  class of stochastic proximal-gradient algorithms.
