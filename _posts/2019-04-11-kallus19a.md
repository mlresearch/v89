title: Interval Estimation of Individual-Level Causal Effects Under Unobserved Confounding
abstract: We study the problem of learning conditional average treatment effects (CATE)
  from observational data with unobserved confounders. The CATE function maps baseline
  covariates to individual causal effect predictions and is key for personalized assessments.
  Recent work has focused on how to learn CATE under unconfoundedness, i.e., when
  there are no unobserved confounders. Since CATE may not be identified when unconfoundedness
  is violated, we develop a functional interval estimator that predicts bounds on
  the individual causal effects under realistic violations of unconfoundedness. Our
  estimator takes the form of a weighted kernel estimator with weights that vary adversarially.
  We prove that our estimator is sharp in that it converges exactly to the tightest
  bounds possible on CATE when there may be unobserved confounders. Further, we study
  personalized decision rules derived from our estimator and prove that they achieve
  optimal minimax regret asymptotically. We assess our approach in a simulation study
  as well as demonstrate its application in the case of hormone replacement therapy
  by comparing conclusions from a real observational study and clinical trial.
