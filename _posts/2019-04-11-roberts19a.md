title: Reversible Jump Probabilistic Programming
abstract: In this paper we present a method for automatically deriving a Reversible
  Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler from probabilistic programs that specify the
  target and proposal distributions. The main challenge in automatically deriving
  such an inference procedure, in comparison to deriving a generic Metropolis-Hastings
  sampler, is in calculating the Jacobian adjustment to the proposal acceptance ratio.
  To achieve this, our approach relies on the interaction of several different components,
  including automatic differentiation, transformation inversion, and optimised code
  generation. We also present Stochaskell, a new probabilistic programming language
  embedded in Haskell, which provides an implementation of our method.
