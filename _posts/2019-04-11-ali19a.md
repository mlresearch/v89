title: A Continuous-Time View of Early Stopping for Least Squares Regression
abstract: We study the statistical properties of the iterates generated by gradient
  descent, applied to the fundamental problem of least squares regression. We take
  a continuous-time view, i.e., consider infinitesimal step sizes in gradient descent,
  in which case the iterates form a trajectory called gradient flow.  Our primary
  focus is to compare the risk of gradient flow to that of ridge regression. Under
  the calibration $t=1/\lambda$—where $t$ is the time parameter in gradient flow,
  and $\lambda$ the tuning parameter in ridge regression—we prove that the risk of
  gradient flow is no less than 1.69 times that of ridge, along the entire path (for
  all $t \geq 0$). This holds in finite samples with very weak assumptions on the
  data model (in particular, with no assumptions on the features $X$). We prove that
  the same relative risk bound holds for prediction risk, in an average sense over
  the underlying signal $\beta_0$.   Finally, we examine limiting risk expressions
  (under standard Marchenko-Pastur asymptotics), and give supporting numerical experiments.
