title: Adversarial Discrete Sequence Generation without Explicit NeuralNetworks as
  Discriminators
abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to train GANs for discrete sequence
  generation without resorting to an explicit neural network as the discriminator.
  We show that when an alternative mini-max optimization procedure is performed for
  the value function where a closed form solution for the discriminator exists in
  the maximization step, it is equivalent to directly optimizing the Jenson-Shannon
  divergence (JSD) between the generator’s distribution and the empirical distribution
  over the training data without sampling from the generator, thus optimizing the
  JSD becomes computationally tractable to train the generator that generates sequences
  of discrete data. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate
  significant improvements over existing methods to train GANs that generate discrete
  sequences.
