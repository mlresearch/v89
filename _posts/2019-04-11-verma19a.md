title: Online Algorithm for Unsupervised Sensor Selection
abstract: In many security and healthcare systems, the detection and diagnosis systems
  use a sequence of sensors/tests. Each test outputs a prediction of the latent state
  and carries an inherent cost. However, the correctness of the predictions cannot
  be evaluated due to unavailability of the ground-truth annotations. Our objective
  is to learn strategies for selecting a test that gives the best trade-off between
  accuracy and costs in such unsupervised sensor selection (USS) problems. Clearly,
  learning is feasible only if ground truth can be inferred (explicitly or implicitly)
  from the problem structure. It is observed that this happens if the problem satisfies
  the ’Weak Dominance’ (WD) property. We set up the USS problem as a stochastic partial
  monitoring problem and develop an algorithm with sub-linear regret under the WD
  property. We argue that our algorithm is optimal and evaluate its performance on
  problem instances generated from synthetic and real-world datasets.
