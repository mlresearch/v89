title: Avoiding Latent Variable Collapse with Generative Skip Models
abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) learn distributions of high-dimensional
  data. They model data with a deep latent-variable model and then fit the model by
  maximizing a lower bound of the log marginal likelihood. VAEs can capture complex
  distributions, but they can also suffer from an issue known as "latent variable
  collapse," especially if the likelihood model is powerful. Specifically, the lower
  bound involves an approximate posterior of the latent variables; this posterior
  "collapses" when it is set equal to the prior, i.e., when the approximate posterior
  is independent of the data. While VAEs learn good generative models, latent variable
  collapse prevents them from learning useful representations. In this paper, we propose
  a simple new way to avoid latent variable collapse by including skip connections
  in our generative model; these connections enforce strong links between the latent
  variables and the likelihood function. We study generative skip models both theoretically
  and empirically. Theoretically, we prove that skip models increase the mutual information
  between the observations and the inferred latent variables. Empirically, we study
  images (MNIST and Omniglot) and text (Yahoo). Compared to existing VAE architectures,
  we show that generative skip models maintain similar predictive performance but
  lead to less collapse and provide more meaningful representations of the data.
