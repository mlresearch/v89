title: Low-Dimensional Density Ratio Estimation for Covariate Shift Correction
abstract: Covariate shift is a prevalent setting for supervised learning in the wild
  when the training and test data are drawn from different time periods, different
  but related domains, or via different sampling strategies.  This paper addresses
  a transfer learning setting, with covariate shift between source and target domains.
  Most existing methods for correcting covariate shift exploit density ratios of the
  features to reweight the source-domain data, and when the features are high-dimensional,
  the estimated density ratios may suffer large estimation variances, leading to poor
  performance of prediction under covariate shift. In this work, we investigate the
  dependence of covariate shift correction performance on the dimensionality of the
  features, and  propose a correction method that finds a low-dimensional representation
  of the features, which takes into account feature relevant to the target $Y$, and
  exploits the density ratio of this representation for importance reweighting. We
  discuss the factors that affect the performance of our method, and demonstrate its
  capabilities on both pseudo-real data and real-world applications.
