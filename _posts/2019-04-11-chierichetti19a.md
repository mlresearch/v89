title: Matroids, Matchings, and Fairness
abstract: The need for fairness in machine learning algorithms is increasingly critical.
  A recent focus has been on developing fair versions of classical algorithms, such
  as those for bandit learning, regression, and clustering. In this work we extend
  this line of work to include algorithms for optimization subject to one or multiple
  matroid constraints. We map out a series of results, showing optimal solutions,
  approximation algorithms, and hardness proofs depending on the specific flavor of
  the problem. Our algorithms are efficient and empirical experiments demonstrate
  that fairness can be achieved with a modest compromise to the overall objective
  value.
