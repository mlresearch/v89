title: A Memoization Framework for Scaling Submodular Optimization to Large Scale
  Problems
abstract: We are motivated by large scale submodular optimization problems, where
  standard algorithms, which treat the submodular functions in the value oracle model,
  do not scale. In this paper, we present a new model called the pre-computational
  complexity model, along with a unifying memoization based framework, which looks
  at the specific form of the given submodular function. A key ingredient in this
  framework, is the notion of a precomputed statistic, which is maintained in the
  course of the algorithms. We show that we can easily integrate this idea into a
  large class of submodular optimization problems including constrained and unconstrained
  submodular maximization, minimization, difference of submodular optimization, ratio
  of submodular optimization and several other related optimization problems. Moreover,
  memoization can be integrated in both discrete and continuous relaxation flavors
  of algorithms for these problems. We demonstrate this idea for several commonly
  occurring submodular functions, and show how the pre-computational model provides
  significant speedups compared to the value oracle model. Finally, we empirically
  demonstrate this for large scale machine learning problems of data subset selection
  and summarization.
