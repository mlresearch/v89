title: Classification using margin pursuit
abstract: In this work, we study a new approach to optimizing the margin distribution
  realized by binary classifiers, in which the learner searches the hypothesis space
  in such a way that a pre-set margin level ends up being a distribution-robust estimator
  of the margin location. This procedure is easily implemented using gradient descent,
  and admits finite-sample bounds on the excess risk under unbounded inputs, yielding
  competitive rates under mild assumptions. Empirical tests on real-world benchmark
  data reinforce the basic principles highlighted by the theory.
