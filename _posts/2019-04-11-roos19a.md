title: Active Probabilistic Inference on Matrices for Pre-Conditioning in Stochastic
  Optimization
abstract: Pre-conditioning is a well-known concept that can significantly improve
  the convergence of optimization algorithms. For noise-free problems, where good
  pre-conditioners are not known a priori, iterative linear algebra methods offer
  one way to efficiently construct them. For the stochastic optimization problems
  that dominate contemporary machine learning, however, this approach is not readily
  available. We propose an iterative algorithm inspired by classic iterative linear
  solvers that uses a probabilistic model to actively infer a pre-conditioner in situations
  where Hessian-projections can only be constructed with strong Gaussian noise. The
  algorithm is empirically demonstrated to efficiently construct effective pre-conditioners
  for stochastic gradient descent and its variants. Experiments on problems of comparably
  low dimensionality show improved convergence. In very high-dimensional problems,
  such as those encountered in deep learning, the pre-conditioner effectively becomes
  an automatic learning-rate adaptation scheme, which we also show to empirically
  work well.
