title: Implicit Kernel Learning
abstract: Kernels are powerful and versatile tools in machine learning and statistics.
  Although the notion of universal kernels and characteristic kernels has been studied,
  kernel selection still greatly influences the empirical performance. While learning
  the kernel in a data driven way has been investigated, in this paper we explore
  learning the spectral distribution of kernel via implicit generative models parametrized
  by deep neural networks. We called our method Implicit Kernel Learning (IKL). The
  proposed framework is simple to train and inference is performed via sampling random
  Fourier features. We investigate two applications of the proposed IKL as examples,
  including generative adversarial networks with MMD (MMD GAN) and standard supervised
  learning. Empirically, MMD GAN with IKL outperforms vanilla predefined kernels on
  both image and text generation benchmarks; using IKL with Random Kitchen Sinks also
  leads to substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art kernel learning
  algorithms on popular supervised learning benchmarks. Theory and conditions for
  using IKL in both applications are also studied as well as connections to previous
  state-of-the-art methods.
