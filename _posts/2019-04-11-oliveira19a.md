title: Bayesian optimisation under uncertain inputs
abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) has been a successful approach to optimise functions
  which are expensive to evaluate and whose observations are noisy. Classical BO algorithms,
  however, do not account for errors about the location where observations are taken,
  which is a common issue in problems with physical components. In these cases, the
  estimation of the actual query location is also subject to uncertainty. In this
  context, we propose an upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm for BO problems where
  both the outcome of a query and the true query location are uncertain. The algorithm
  employs a Gaussian process model that takes probability distributions as inputs.
  Theoretical results are provided for both the proposed algorithm and a conventional
  UCB approach within the uncertain-inputs setting. Finally, we evaluate each methodâ€™s
  performance experimentally, comparing them to other input noise aware BO approaches
  on simulated scenarios involving synthetic and real data.
