title: "$HS^2$: Active learning over hypergraphs with pointwise and pairwise queries"
abstract: We propose a hypergraph-based active learning scheme which we term $HS^2$;
  $HS^2$ generalizes the previously reported algorithm $S^2$ originally proposed for
  graph-based active learning with pointwise queries. Our $HS^2$ method can accommodate
  hypergraph structures and allows one to ask both pointwise queries and pairwise
  queries. Based on a novel parametric system particularly designed for hypergraphs,
  we derive theoretical results on the query complexity of $HS^2$ for the above described
  generalized settings. Both the theoretical and empirical results show that $HS^2$
  requires a significantly fewer number of queries than $S^2$ when one uses $S^2$
  over a graph obtained from the corresponding hypergraph via clique expansion.
