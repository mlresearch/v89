title: Variance reduction properties of the reparameterization trick
abstract: The reparameterization trick is widely used in variational inference as
  it yields more accurate estimates of the gradient of the variational objective than
  alternative approaches such as the score function method. Although there is overwhelming
  empirical evidence in the literature showing its success, there is relatively little
  research exploring why the reparameterization trick is so effective. We explore
  this under the idealized assumptions that the variational approximation is a mean-field
  Gaussian density and that the log of the joint density of the model parameters and
  the data is a quadratic function that depends on the variational mean. From this,
  we show that the marginal variances of the reparameterization gradient estimator
  are smaller than those of the score function gradient estimator. We apply the result
  of our idealized analysis to real-world examples.
