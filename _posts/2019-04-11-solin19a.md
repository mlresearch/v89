title: 'Know Your Boundaries: Constraining Gaussian Processes by Variational Harmonic
  Features'
abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a powerful framework for extrapolation,
  interpolation, and noise removal in regression and classification. This paper considers
  constraining GPs to arbitrarily-shaped domains with boundary conditions. We solve
  a Fourier-like generalised harmonic feature representation of the GP prior in the
  domain of interest, which both constrains the GP and attains a low-rank representation
  that is used for speeding up inference. The method scales as O(nm^2) in prediction
  and O(m^3) in hyperparameter learning for regression, where n is the number of data
  points and m the number of features. Furthermore, we make use of the variational
  approach to allow the method to deal with non-Gaussian likelihoods. The experiments
  cover both simulated and empirical data in which the boundary conditions allow for
  inclusion of additional physical information.
