title: A Topological Regularizer for Classifiers via Persistent Homology
abstract: Regularization plays a crucial role in supervised learning. Most existing
  methods enforce a global regularization in a structure agnostic manner. In this
  paper, we initiate a new direction and propose to enforce the structural simplicity
  of the classification boundary by regularizing over its topological complexity.
  In particular, our measurement of topological complexity incorporates the importance
  of topological features (e.g., connected components, handles, and so on) in a meaningful
  manner, and provides a direct control over spurious topological structures. We incorporate
  the new measurement as a topological penalty in training classifiers. We also propose
  an efficient algorithm to compute the gradient of such penalty. Our method provides
  a novel way to topologically simplify the global structure of the model, without
  having to sacrifice too much of the flexibility of the model. We demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our new topological regularizer on a range of synthetic and real-world
  datasets.
