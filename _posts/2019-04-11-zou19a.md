title: Sampling from Non-Log-Concave Distributions via Variance-Reduced Gradient Langevin
  Dynamics
abstract: We study stochastic variance reduction-based Langevin dynamic algorithms,
  SVRG-LD and SAGA-LD \citep{dubey2016variance}, for sampling from non-log-concave
  distributions. Under certain assumptions on the log density function, we establish
  the convergence guarantees of SVRG-LD and SAGA-LD in $2$-Wasserstein distance. More
  specifically, we show that both SVRG-LD and SAGA-LD require $ \tilde O\big(n+n^{3/4}/\epsilon^2
  + n^{1/2}/\epsilon^4\big)\cdot \exp\big(\tilde O(d+\gamma)\big)$ stochastic gradient
  evaluations to achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in $2$-Wasserstein distance, which outperforms
  the $ \tilde O\big(n/\epsilon^4\big)\cdot \exp\big(\tilde O(d+\gamma)\big)$ gradient
  complexity achieved by Langevin Monte Carlo Method \citep{raginsky2017non}. Experiments
  on synthetic data and real data back up our theory.
