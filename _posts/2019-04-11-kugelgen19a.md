title: 'Semi-Generative Modelling: Covariate-Shift Adaptation with Cause and Effect
  Features'
abstract: Current methods for covariate-shift adaptation use unlabelled data to compute
  importance weights or domain-invariant features, while the final model is trained
  on labelled data only. Here, we consider a particular case of covariate shift which
  allows us also to learn from unlabelled data, that is, combining adaptation and
  semi-supervised learning. Using ideas from causality, we argue that this requires
  learning with both causes, $X_C$, and effects, $X_E$, of a target variable, $Y$,
  and show how this setting leads to what we call a semi-generative model, $P(Y,X_E|X_C,\theta)$.
  Our approach is robust to domain shifts in the distribution of causal features and
  leverages unlabelled data by learning a direct map from causes to effects. Experiments
  on synthetic data demonstrate significant improvements in classification over purely-supervised
  and importance-weighting baselines.
