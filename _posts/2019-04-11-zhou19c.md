title: Direct Acceleration of SAGA using Sampled Negative Momentum
abstract: Variance reduction is a simple and effective technique that accelerates
  convex (or non-convex) stochastic optimization. Among existing variance reduction
  methods, SVRG and SAGA adopt unbiased gradient estimators and are the most popular
  variance reduction methods in recent years. Although various accelerated variants
  of SVRG (e.g., Katyusha and Acc-Prox-SVRG) have been proposed, the direct acceleration
  of SAGA still remains unknown. In this paper, we propose a directly accelerated
  variant of SAGA using a novel Sampled Negative Momentum (SSNM), which achieves the
  best known oracle complexity for strongly convex problems (with known strong convexity
  parameter). Consequently, our work fills the void of directly accelerated SAGA.
