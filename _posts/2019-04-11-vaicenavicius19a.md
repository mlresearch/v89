title: Evaluating model calibration in classification
abstract: Probabilistic classifiers output a probability distribution on target classes
  rather than just a class prediction. Besides providing a clear separation of prediction
  and decision making, the main advantage of probabilistic models is their ability
  to represent uncertainty about predictions. In safety-critical applications, it
  is pivotal for a model to possess an adequate sense of uncertainty, which for probabilistic
  classifiers translates into outputting probability distributions that are consistent
  with the empirical frequencies observed from realized outcomes. A classifier with
  such a property is called calibrated. In this work, we develop a general theoretical
  calibration evaluation framework grounded in probability theory, and point out subtleties
  present in model calibration evaluation that lead to refined interpretations of
  existing evaluation techniques. Lastly, we propose new ways to quantify and visualize
  miscalibration in probabilistic classification, including novel multidimensional
  reliability diagrams.
