title: Robust Graph Embedding with Noisy Link Weights
abstract: We propose $\beta$-graph embedding for robustly learning feature vectors
  from data vectors and noisy link weights. A newly introduced empirical moment $\beta$-score
  reduces the influence of contamination and robustly measures the difference between
  the underlying correct expected weights of links and the specified generative model.
  The proposed method is computationally tractable; we employ a minibatch-based efficient
  stochastic algorithm and prove that this algorithm locally minimizes the empirical
  moment $\beta$-score. We conduct numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world
  datasets.
