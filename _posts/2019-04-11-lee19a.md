title: Temporal Quilting for Survival Analysis
abstract: The importance of survival analysis in many disciplines (especially in medicine)
  has led to the development of a variety of approaches to modeling the survival function.
  Models constructed via various approaches offer different strengths and weaknesses
  in terms of discriminative performance and calibration, but no one model is best
  across all datasets or even across all time horizons within a single dataset. Because
  we require both good calibration and good discriminative performance over different
  time horizons, conventional model selection and ensemble approaches are not applicable.
  This paper develops a novel approach that combines the collective intelligence of
  different underlying survival models to produce a valid survival function that is
  well-calibrated and offers superior discriminative performance at different time
  horizons. Empirical results show that our approach provides significant gains over
  the benchmarks on a variety of real-world datasets.
