title: Variational Information Planning for Sequential Decision Making
abstract: We consider the setting of sequential decision making where, at each  stage,
  potential actions are evaluated based on expected reduction in posterior uncertainty,
  given by mutual information (MI).  As MI typically lacks a closed form, we propose
  an approach which maintains variational approximations of, both, the posterior and
  MI utility.  Our planning objective extends an established variational bound on
  MI to the setting of sequential planning. The result, variational information planning
  (VIP), is an efficient method for  sequential decision making.  We further establish
  convexity of the variational planning objective and, under conditional exponential  family
  approximations, we show that the optimal MI bound arises from a relaxation of the
  well-known exponential family moment matching  property.  We demonstrate VIP for
  sensor selection, experiment design, and active learning, where it meets or exceeds
  methods requiring more computation, or those specialized to the task.
