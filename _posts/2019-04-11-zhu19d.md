title: Cost aware Inference for IoT Devices
abstract: Networked embedded devices (IoTs) of limited CPU, memory and power resources
  are revolutionizing data gathering, remote monitoring and planning in many consumer
  and business applications. Nevertheless, resource limitations place a significant
  burden on their service life and operation, warranting cost-aware methods that are
  capable of distributively screening redundancies in device information and transmitting
  informative data. We propose to train a decentralized gated network that, given
  an observed instance at test-time, allows for activation of select devices to transmit
  information to a central node, which then performs inference. We analyze our proposed
  gradient descent algorithm for Gaussian features and establish convergence guarantees
  under good initialization. We conduct experiments on a number of real-world datasets
  arising in IoT applications and show that our model results in over 1.5X service
  life with negligible accuracy degradation relative to a performance achievable by
  a neural network.
