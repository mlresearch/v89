title: Bounding Inefficiency of Equilibria in Continuous Actions Games using Submodularity
  and Curvature
abstract: Games with continuous strategy sets arise in several machine learning problems
  (e.g. adversarial learning). For such games, simple no-regret learning algorithms
  exist in several cases and ensure convergence to coarse correlated equilibria (CCE).  The
  efficiency of such equilibria with respect to a social function, however, is not
  well understood. In this paper, we define the class of valid utility games with
  continuous strategies and provide efficiency bounds for their CCEs. Our bounds rely
  on the social function being a monotone DR-submodular function. We further refine
  our bounds based on the curvature of the social function. Furthermore, we extend
  our efficiency bounds to a class of non-submodular functions that satisfy approximate
  submodularity properties. Finally, we show that valid utility games with continuous
  strategies can be designed to maximize monotone DR-submodular functions subject
  to disjoint constraints with approximation guarantees. The approximation guarantees
  we derive are based on the efficiency of the equilibria of such games and can improve
  the existing ones in the literature. We illustrate and validate our results on a
  budget allocation game and a sensor coverage problem.
