title: 'The LORACs Prior for VAEs: Letting the Trees Speak for the Data'
abstract: In variational autoencoders, the prior on the latent codes $z$ is often
  treated as an afterthought, but the prior shapes the kind of latent representation
  that the model learns. If the goal is to learn a representation that is interpretable
  and useful, then the prior should reflect the ways in which the high-level factors
  that describe the data vary. The “default” prior is a standard normal, but if the
  natural factors of variation in the dataset exhibit discrete structure or are not
  independent, then the isotropic-normal prior will actually encourage learning representations
  that \emph{mask} this structure. To alleviate this problem, we propose using a flexible
  Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical clustering prior based on the time-marginalized
  coalescent (TMC). To scale learning to large datasets, we develop a new inducing-point
  approximation and inference algorithm. We then apply the method without supervision
  to several datasets and examine the interpretability and practical performance of
  the inferred hierarchies and learned latent space.
