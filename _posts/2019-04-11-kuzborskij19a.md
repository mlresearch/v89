title: Efficient Linear Bandits through Matrix Sketching
abstract: We prove that two popular linear contextual bandit algorithms, OFUL and
  Thompson Sampling, can be made efficient using Frequent Directions, a deterministic
  online sketching technique. More precisely, we show that a sketch of size $m$ allows
  a $\mathcal{O}(md)$ update time for both algorithms, as opposed to $\Omega(d^2)$
  required by their non-sketched versions in general (where $d$ is the dimension of
  context vectors). This computational speedup is accompanied by regret bounds of
  order $(1+\varepsilon_m)^{3/2}d\sqrt{T}$ for OFUL and of order $\big((1+\varepsilon_m)d\big)^{3/2}\sqrt{T}$
  for Thompson Sampling, where $\varepsilon_m$ is bounded by the sum of the tail eigenvalues
  not covered by the sketch. In particular, when the selected contexts span a subspace
  of dimension at most $m$, our algorithms have a regret bound matching that of their
  slower, non-sketched counterparts. Experiments on real-world datasets corroborate
  our theoretical results.
