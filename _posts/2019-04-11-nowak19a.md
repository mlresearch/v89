title: Sharp Analysis of Learning with Discrete Losses
abstract: The problem of devising learning strategies for discrete losses (e.g., multilabeling,
  ranking) is currently addressed with methods and theoretical analyses ad-hoc for
  each loss.  In this paper we study a least-squares framework to systematically design
  learning algorithms for discrete losses, with quantitative characterizations in
  terms of statistical and computational complexity. In particular, we improve existing
  results by providing explicit dependence on the number of labels for a wide class
  of losses and faster learning rates in conditions of low-noise.  Theoretical results
  are complemented with experiments on real datasets, showing the effectiveness of
  the proposed general approach.
