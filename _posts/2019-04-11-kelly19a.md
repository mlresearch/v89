title: Adaptive Rao-Blackwellisation in Gibbs Sampling for Probabilistic Graphical
  Models
abstract: Rao-Blackwellisation is a technique that provably improves the performance
  of Gibbs sampling by summing-out variables from the PGM. However, collapsing variables
  is computationally expensive, since it changes the PGM structure introducing factors
  whose size is dependent upon the Markov blanket of the variable. Therefore, collapsing
  out several variables jointly is typically intractable in arbitrary PGM structures.
  In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach for Rao-Blackwellisation, where we
  add parallel Markov chains defined over different collapsed PGM structures. The
  collapsed variables are chosen based on their convergence diagnostics. However,
  adding a new chain requires burn-in, thus wasting samples. To address this, we initialize
  the new chains from a mean field approximation for the distribution, that improves
  over time, thus reducing the burn-in period. Our experiments on several UAI benchmarks
  shows that our approach is more accurate than state-of-the-art inference systems
  such as Merlin that implements algorithms that have previously won the UAI inference
  challenge.
