title: Causal Discovery in the Presence of Missing Data
abstract: Missing data are ubiquitous in many domains such as healthcare. When these
  data entries are not missing completely at random, the (conditional) independence
  relations in the observed data may be different from those in the complete data
  generated by the underlying causal process. Consequently, simply applying existing
  causal discovery methods to the observed data may lead to wrong conclusions. In
  this paper, we aim at developing a causal discovery method to recover the underlying
  causal structure from observed data that are missing under different mechanisms,
  including missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing
  not at random (MNAR). With missingness mechanisms represented by missingness graphs
  (m-graphs), we analyze conditions under which additional correction is needed to
  derive conditional independence/dependence relations in the complete data. Based
  on our analysis, we propose Missing Value PC (MVPC), which extends the PC algorithm
  to incorporate additional corrections. Our proposed MVPC is shown in theory to give
  asymptotically correct results even on data that are MAR or MNAR. Experimental results
  on both synthetic data and real healthcare applications illustrate that the proposed
  algorithm is able to find correct causal relations even in the general case of MNAR.
