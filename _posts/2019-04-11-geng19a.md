title: Optimal Noise-Adding Mechanism in Additive Differential Privacy
abstract: We derive the optimal $(0, \delta)$-differentially private query-output
  independent noise-adding mechanism for single real-valued query function under a
  general cost-minimization framework. Under a mild technical condition, we show that
  the optimal noise probability distribution is a uniform distribution with a probability
  mass at the origin. We explicitly derive the optimal noise distribution for general
  $\ell^p$ cost functions, including $\ell^1$ (for noise magnitude) and $\ell^2$ (for
  noise power) cost functions, and show that the probability concentration on the
  origin occurs when $\delta > \frac{p}{p+1}$. Our result demonstrates an improvement
  over the existing Gaussian mechanisms  by a factor of two and three for $(0,\delta)$-differential
  privacy in the high privacy regime in the context of minimizing the noise magnitude
  and noise power, and the gain is more pronounced in the low privacy regime. Our
  result is consistent with the existing result for $(0,\delta)$-differential privacy
  in the discrete setting, and identifies a probability concentration phenomenon in
  the continuous setting.
