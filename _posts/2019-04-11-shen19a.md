title: Robust Matrix Completion from Quantized Observations
abstract: 1-bit matrix completion refers to the problem of recovering a real-valued
  low-rank matrix from a small fraction of its sign patterns. In many real-world applications,
  however, the observations are not only highly quantized, but also grossly corrupted.
  In this work, we consider the noisy statistical model where each observed entry
  can be flipped with some probability after quantization. We propose a simple maximum
  likelihood estimator which is shown to be robust to the sign flipping noise. In
  particular, we prove an upper bound on the statistical error, showing that with
  overwhelming probability $n = O(poly(1-2E[\tau])^{-2} rd \log d)$ samples are sufficient
  for accurate recovery, where $r$ and $d$ are the rank and dimension of the underlying
  matrix respectively, and tau in $[0, 1/2)$ is a random variable that parameterizes
  the sign flipping noise. Furthermore, a lower bound is established showing that
  the obtained sample complexity is near-optimal for prevalent statistical models.
  Finally, we substantiate our theoretical findings with a comprehensive study on
  synthetic and realistic data sets, and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance.
