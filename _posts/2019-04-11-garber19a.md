title: Fast Stochastic Algorithms for Low-rank and Nonsmooth Matrix Problems
abstract: 'Composite convex optimization problems which include both a nonsmooth term
  and a low-rank promoting term have important applications in machine learning and
  signal processing, such as when one wishes to recover an unknown matrix that is  simultaneously
  low-rank and sparse. However, such problems are highly challenging to solve in large-scale:
  the low-rank promoting term prohibits efficient implementations of proximal methods
  for composite optimization and even simple subgradient methods. On the other hand,
  methods which are tailored for low-rank optimization, such as conditional gradient-type
  methods, which are often applied to a smooth approximation of the nonsmooth objective,
  are slow since their runtime scales with both the large Lipchitz parameter of the
  smoothed gradient vector and with $1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy.
  In this paper we develop efficient algorithms for \textit{stochastic} optimization
  of a strongly-convex objective which includes both a nonsmooth term and a low-rank
  promoting term. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first
  algorithm that enjoys all following critical properties for large-scale problems:
  i) (nearly) optimal sample complexity, ii) each iteration requires only a single
  \textit{low-rank} SVD computation, and iii) overall number of thin-SVD computations
  scales only with $\log{1/\epsilon}$ (as opposed to $\textrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ in
  previous methods). We also give an algorithm for the closely-related finite-sum
  setting. We empirically demonstrate our results on the problem of recovering a simultaneously
  low-rank and sparse matrix.'
