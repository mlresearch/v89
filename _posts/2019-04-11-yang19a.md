title: A Stein–Papangelou Goodness-of-Fit Test for Point Processes
abstract: Point processes provide a powerful framework for modeling the distribution
  and interactions of events in time or space. Their flexibility has given rise to
  a variety of sophisticated models in statistics and machine learning, yet model
  diagnostic and criticism techniques remain underdeveloped. In this work, we propose
  a general Stein operator for point processes based on the Papangelou conditional
  intensity function. We then establish a kernel goodness-of-fit test by defining
  a Stein discrepancy measure for general point processes. Notably, our test also
  applies to non-Poisson point processes whose intensity functions contain intractable
  normalization constants due to the presence of complex interactions among points.
  We apply our proposed test to several point process models, and show that it outperforms
  a two-sample test based on the maximum mean discrepancy.
