title: Towards a Theoretical Understanding of Hashing-Based Neural Nets
abstract: Parameter reduction has been a popular topic in deep learning due to the
  ever- increasing size of deep neural network models and the need to train and run
  deep neural nets on resource limited machines. Despite many efforts in this area,
  there were no rigorous theoretical guarantees on why existing neural net compression
  methods should work. In this paper, we provide provable guarantees on some hashing-based
  parameter reduction methods in neural nets. First, we introduce a neural net compression
  scheme based on random linear sketching (which is usually implemented efficiently
  via hashing), and show that the sketched (smaller) network is able to approximate
  the original network on all input data coming from any smooth well-conditioned low-dimensional
  manifold. The sketched network can also be trained directly via back-propagation.
  Next, we study the previously proposed HashedNets architecture and show that the
  optimization landscape of one-hidden-layer HashedNets has a local strong convexity
  property similar to a normal fully connected neural network. Together with the initialization
  algorithm developed in [51], this implies that the parameters in HashedNets can
  be provably recovered. We complement our theoretical results with some empirical
  verification.
