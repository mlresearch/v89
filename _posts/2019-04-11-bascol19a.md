title: From Cost-Sensitive Classification to Tight F-measure Bounds
abstract: The F-measure is a classification performance measure, especially suited
  when dealing with imbalanced datasets, which provides a compromise between the precision
  and the recall of a classifier. As this measure is non convex and non linear, it
  is often indirectly optimized using cost-sensitive learning (that affects different
  costs to false positives and false negatives). In this article, we derive theoretical
  guarantees that give tight bounds on the best F-measure that can be obtained from
  cost-sensitive learning. We also give an original geometric interpretation of the
  bounds that serves as an inspiration for CONE, a new algorithm to optimize for the
  F-measure. Using 10 datasets exhibiting varied class imbalance, we illustrate that
  our bounds are much tighter than previous work and show that CONE learns models
  with either superior F-measures than existing methods or comparable but in fewer
  iterations.
