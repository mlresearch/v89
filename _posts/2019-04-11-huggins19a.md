title: Scalable Gaussian Process Inference with Finite-data Mean and Variance Guarantees
abstract: 'Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a flexible class of priors for nonparametric
  Bayesian regression, but popular GP posterior inference methods are typically prohibitively
  slow or lack desirable finite-data guarantees on quality. We develop a scalable
  approach to approximate GP regression, with finite-data guarantees on the accuracy
  of our pointwise posterior mean and variance estimates. Our main contribution is
  a novel objective for approximate inference in the nonparametric setting: the preconditioned
  Fisher (pF) divergence. We show that unlike the Kullback–Leibler divergence (used
  in variational inference), the pF divergence bounds bounds the 2-Wasserstein distance,
  which in turn provides tight bounds on the pointwise error of mean and variance
  estimates. We demonstrate that, for sparse GP likelihood approximations, we can
  minimize the pF divergence bounds efficiently. Our experiments show that optimizing
  the pF divergence bounds has the same computational requirements as variational
  sparse GPs while providing comparable empirical performance—in addition to our novel
  finite-data quality guarantees.'
