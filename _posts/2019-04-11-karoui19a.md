title: The non-parametric bootstrap and spectral analysis in moderate and high-dimension
abstract: We consider the properties of the bootstrap as a tool for inference concerning
  the eigenvalues of a sample covariance matrix computed from an n x p data matrix
  X. We focus on the modern framework where p/n is not close to 0 but remains bounded
  as n and p tend to infinity. Through a mix of numerical and theoretical considerations,
  we show that the non-parametric bootstrap is not in general a reliable inferential
  tool in the setting we consider. However, in the case where the population covariance
  matrix is well-approximated by a finite rank matrix, the non-parametric bootstrap
  performs as it does in finite dimension.
