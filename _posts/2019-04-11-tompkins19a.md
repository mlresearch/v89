title: Black Box Quantiles for Kernel Learning
abstract: Kernel methods have been successfully used in various domains to model nonlinear
  patterns. However, the structure of the kernels is typically handcrafted for each
  dataset based on the experience of the data analyst. In this paper, we present a
  novel technique to learn kernels that best fit the data. We exploit the measure-theoretic
  view of a shift-invariant kernel given by the Bochner’s theorem, and automatically
  learn the measure in terms of a parameterized quantile function. This flexible black
  box quantile function, evaluated on Quasi-Monte Carlo samples, builds up quasi-random
  Fourier feature maps that can approximate arbitrary kernels. The proposed method
  is not only general enough to be used in any kernel machine, but can also be combined
  with other kernel design techniques. We learn expressive kernels on a variety of
  datasets, verifying the methods ability to automatically  discover complex patterns
  without being guided by human expert knowledge.
