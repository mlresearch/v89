title: Detection of Planted Solutions for Flat Satisfiability Problems
abstract: We study the detection problem of finding planted solutions in random instances
  of flat satisfiability problems, a generalization of boolean satisfiability formulas.
  We describe the properties of random instances of flat satisfiability, as well of
  the optimal rates of detection of the associated hypothesis testing problem. We
  also study the performance of an algorithmically efficient testing procedure. We
  introduce a modification of our model, the light planting of solutions, and show
  that it is as hard as the problem of learning parity with noise. This hints strongly
  at the difficulty of detecting planted flat satisfiability for a wide class of tests.
