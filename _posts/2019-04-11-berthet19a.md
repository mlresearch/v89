title: Statistical Windows in Testing for the Initial Distribution of a Reversible
  Markov Chain
abstract: We study the problem of hypothesis testing between two discrete distributions,
  where we only have access to samples after the action of a known reversible Markov
  chain, playing the role of noise. We derive instance-dependent minimax rates for
  the sample complexity of this problem, and show how its dependence in time is related
  to the spectral properties of the Markov chain. We show that there exists a wide
  statistical window, in terms of sample complexity for hypothesis testing between
  different pairs of initial distributions. We illustrate these results in several
  concrete examples.
