title: 'Derivative-Free Methods for Policy Optimization: Guarantees for Linear Quadratic
  Systems'
abstract: We study derivative-free methods for policy optimization over the class
  of linear policies. We focus on characterizing the convergence rate of a canonical
  stochastic, two-point, derivative-free method for linear-quadratic systems in which
  the initial state of the system is drawn at random. In particular, we show that
  for problems with effective dimension $D$, such a method converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate
  solution within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(D/\epsilon)$ steps, with multiplicative
  pre-factors that are explicit lower-order polynomial terms in the curvature parameters
  of the problem. Along the way, we also derive stochastic zero-order rates for a
  class of non-convex optimization problems.
