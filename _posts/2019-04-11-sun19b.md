title: Least Squares Estimation of Weakly Convex Functions
abstract: Function estimation under shape restrictions, such as convexity, has many
  practical applications and has drawn a lot of recent interests. In this work we
  argue that convexity, as a global property, is too strict and prone to outliers.
  Instead, we propose to use weakly convex functions as a simple alternative to quantify
  “approximate convexity”—a notion that is perhaps more relevant in practice. We prove
  that, unlike convex functions, weakly convex functions can exactly interpolate any
  finite dataset and they are universal approximators. Through regularizing the modulus
  of convexity, we show that weakly convex functions can be efficiently estimated
  both statistically and algorithmically, requiring minimal modifications to existing
  algorithms and theory for estimating convex functions. Our numerical experiments
  confirm the class of weakly convex functions as another competitive alternative
  for nonparametric estimation.
