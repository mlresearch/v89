title: 'MaxHedge: Maximizing a Maximum Online'
abstract: We introduce a new online learning framework where, at each trial, the learner
  is required to select a subset of actions from a given known action set. Each action
  is associated with an energy value, a reward and a cost. The sum of the energies
  of the actions selected cannot exceed a given energy budget. The goal is to maximise
  the cumulative profit, where the profit obtained on a single trial is defined as
  the difference between the maximum reward among the selected actions and the sum
  of their costs. Action energy values and the budget are known and fixed. All rewards
  and costs associated with each action change over time and are revealed at each
  trial only after the learnerâ€™s selection of actions. Our framework encompasses several
  online learning problems where the environment changes over time; and the solution
  trades-off between minimising the costs and maximising the maximum reward of the
  selected subset of actions, while being constrained to an action energy budget.
  The algorithm that we propose is efficient and general that may be specialised to
  multiple natural online combinatorial problems.
