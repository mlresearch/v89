title: 'Finding the bandit in a graph: Sequential search-and-stop'
abstract: We consider the problem where an agent wants to find a hidden object that
  is randomly located in some vertex of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) according to
  a fixed but possibly unknown distribution. The agent can only examine vertices whose
  in-neighbors have already been examined. In this paper, we address a learning setting
  where we allow the agent to stop before having found the object and restart searching
  on a new independent instance of the same problem. Our goal is to maximize the total
  number of hidden objects found given a time budget. The agent can thus skip an instance
  after realizing that it would spend too much time on it.  Our contributions are
  both to the search theory and multi-armed bandits. If the distribution is known,
  we provide a quasi-optimal and efficient stationary strategy. If the distribution
  is unknown, we additionally show how to sequentially approximate it and, at the
  same time, act near-optimally in order to collect as many hidden objects as possible.
