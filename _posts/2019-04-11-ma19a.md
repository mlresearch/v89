title: Learning Invariant Representations with Kernel Warping
abstract: Invariance is an effective prior that has been extensively used to bias
  supervised learning with a \emph{given} representation of data. In order to learn
  invariant representations,  wavelet and scattering based methods “hard code” invariance
  over the \emph{entire} sample space, hence restricted to a limited range of transformations.
  Kernels based on Haar integration also work only on a \emph{group} of transformations.
  In this work, we break this limitation by designing a new representation learning
  algorithm that incorporates invariances \emph{beyond transformation}. Our approach,
  which is based on warping the kernel in a data-dependent fashion, is computationally
  efficient using random features, and leads to a deep kernel through multiple layers.
  We apply it to convolutional kernel networks and demonstrate its stability.
