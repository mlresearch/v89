title: Unbiased Implicit Variational Inference
abstract: We develop unbiased implicit variational inference (UIVI), a method that
  expands the applicability of variational inference by defining an expressive variational
  family. UIVI considers an implicit variational distribution obtained in a hierarchical
  manner using a simple reparameterizable distribution whose variational parameters
  are defined by arbitrarily flexible deep neural networks. Unlike previous works,
  UIVI directly optimizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) rather than an approximation
  to the ELBO. We demonstrate UIVI on several models, including Bayesian multinomial
  logistic regression and variational autoencoders, and show that UIVI achieves both
  tighter ELBO and better predictive performance than existing approaches at a similar
  computational cost.
