title: Data-dependent compression of random features for large-scale kernel approximation
abstract: Kernel methods offer the flexibility to learn complex relationships in modern,
  large data sets while enjoying strong theoretical guarantees on quality. Unfortunately,
  these methods typically require cubic running time in the data set size, a prohibitive
  cost in the large- data setting. Random feature maps (RFMs) and the Nystroöm method
  both consider low- rank approximations to the kernel matrix as a potential solution.
  But, in order to achieve desirable theoretical guarantees, the former may require
  a prohibitively large number of features J+, and the latter may be prohibitively
  expensive for high-dimensional problems. We propose to combine the simplicity and
  generality of RFMs with a data-dependent feature selection scheme to achieve desirable
  theoretical approximation properties of Nyström with just $O(\log J+)$ features.
  Our key insight is to begin with a large set of random features, then reduce them
  to a small number of weighted features in a data-dependent, computationally efficient
  way, while preserving the statistical guarantees of using the original large set
  of features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with theory and experiments-including
  on a data set with over 50 million observations. In particular, we show that our
  method achieves small kernel matrix approximation error and better test set accuracy
  with provably fewer random features than state-of-the-art methods.
