title: 'Learning Mixtures of Smooth Product Distributions: Identifiability and Algorithm'
abstract: We study the problem of learning a mixture model of non-parametric product
  distributions. The problem of learning a mixture model is that of finding the component
  distributions along with the mixing weights using observed samples generated from
  the mixture. The problem is well-studied in the parametric setting, i.e., when the
  component distributions are members of a parametric family - such as Gaussian distributions.
  In this work, we focus on multivariate mixtures of non-parametric product distributions
  and propose a two-stage approach which recovers the component distributions of the
  mixture under a smoothness condition. Our approach builds upon the identifiability
  properties of the canonical polyadic (low-rank) decomposition of tensors, in tandem
  with Fourier and Shannon-Nyquist sampling staples from signal processing. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the approach on synthetic and real datasets.
