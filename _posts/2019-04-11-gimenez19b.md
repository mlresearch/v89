title: 'Improving the Stability of the Knockoff Procedure: Multiple Simultaneous Knockoffs
  and Entropy Maximization'
abstract: 'The Model-X knockoff procedure has recently emerged as a powerful approach
  for feature selection with statistical guarantees. The advantage of knockoffs is
  that if we have a good model of the features X, then we can identify salient features
  without knowing anything about how the outcome Y depends on X. An important drawback
  of knockoffs is its instability: running the procedure twice can result in very
  different selected features, potentially leading to different conclusions. Addressing
  this instability is critical for obtaining reproducible and robust results. Here
  we present a generalization of the knockoff procedure that we call simultaneous
  multi-knockoffs. We show that multi-knockoffs guarantee false discovery rate (FDR)
  control, and are substantially more stable and powerful compared to the standard
  (single) knockoffs.  Moreover we propose a new algorithm based on entropy maximization
  for generating Gaussian multi-knockoffs. We validate the improved stability and
  power of multi-knockoffs in systematic experiments. We also illustrate how multi-knockoffs
  can improve the accuracy of detecting genetic mutations that are causally linked
  to phenotypes.'
