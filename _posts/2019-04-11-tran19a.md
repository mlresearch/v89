title: Calibrating Deep Convolutional Gaussian Processes
abstract: The wide adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs in applications
  where decision-making under uncertainty is fundamental, has brought a great deal
  of attention to the ability of these models to accurately quantify the uncertainty
  in their predictions. Previous work on combining CNNs with Gaussian processes GPs
  has been developed under the assumption that the predictive probabilities of these
  models are well-calibrated. In this paper we show that, in fact, current combinations
  of CNNs and GPs are miscalibrated.  We proposes a novel combination that considerably
  outperforms previous approaches on this aspect, while achieving state-of-the-art
  performance on image classification tasks.
