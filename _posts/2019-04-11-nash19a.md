title: Inverting Supervised Representations with Autoregressive Neural Density Models
abstract: We present a method for feature interpretation that makes use of recent
  advances in autoregressive density estimation models to invert model representations.
  We train generative inversion models to express a distribution over input features
  conditioned on intermediate model representations. Insights into the invariances
  learned by supervised models can be gained by viewing samples from these inversion
  models. In addition, we can use these inversion models to estimate the mutual information
  between a model’s inputs and its intermediate representations, thus quantifying
  the amount of information preserved by the network at different stages. Using this
  method we examine the types of information preserved at different layers of convolutional
  neural networks, and explore the invariances induced by different architectural
  choices. Finally we show that the mutual information between inputs and network
  layers initially increases and then decreases over the course of training, supporting
  recent work by Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby (2017) on the information bottleneck theory
  of deep learning.
