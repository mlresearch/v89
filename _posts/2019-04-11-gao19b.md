title: Learning One-hidden-layer Neural Networks under General Input Distributions
abstract: 'Significant advances have been made recently on training neural networks,
  where the main challenge is in solving an optimization problem with abundant critical
  points. However, existing approaches to address this issue crucially rely on a restrictive
  assumption: the training data is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. In this paper,
  we provide a novel unified framework to design loss functions with desirable landscape
  properties for a wide range of general  input distributions. On these loss functions,
  remarkably, stochastic gradient descent theoretically recovers the true parameters
  with \emph{global} initializations and empirically outperforms the existing approaches.
  Our loss function design bridges the notion of score functions with the topic of
  neural network optimization. Central to our approach is the task of estimating the
  score function from samples, which is of basic and independent interest to theoretical
  statistics. Traditional estimation methods (example: kernel based) fail right at
  the outset; we bring statistical methods of local likelihood to design a novel estimator
  of  score functions, that provably adapts to the local geometry of the unknown  density.'
