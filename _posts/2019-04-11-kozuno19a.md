title: Theoretical Analysis of Efficiency and Robustness of Softmax and Gap-Increasing
  Operators in Reinforcement Learning
abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze conservative value iteration, which
  unifies value iteration, soft value iteration, advantage learning, and dynamic policy
  programming. Our analysis shows that algorithms using a combination of gap-increasing
  and max operators are resilient to stochastic errors, but not to non-stochastic
  errors. In contrast, algorithms using a softmax operator without a gap-increasing
  operator are less susceptible to all types of errors, but may display poor asymptotic
  performance. Algorithms using a combination of gap-increasing and softmax operators
  are much more effective and may asymptotically outperform algorithms with the max
  operator. Not only do these theoretical results provide a deep understanding of
  various reinforcement learning algorithms, but they also highlight the effectiveness
  of gap-increasing operators, as well as the limitations of traditional greedy value
  updates by the max operator.
