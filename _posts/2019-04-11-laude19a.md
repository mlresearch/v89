title: Optimization of Inf-Convolution Regularized Nonconvex Composite Problems
abstract: In this work, we consider nonconvex composite problems that involve inf-convolution
  with a Legendre function, which gives rise to an anisotropic generalization of the
  proximal mapping and Moreau-envelope. In a convex setting such problems can be solved
  via alternating minimization of a splitting formulation, where the consensus constraint
  is penalized with a Legendre function. In contrast, for nonconvex models it is in
  general unclear that this approach yields stationary points to the infimal convolution
  problem. To this end we analytically investigate local regularity properties of
  the Moreau-envelope function under prox-regularity, which allows us to establish
  the equivalence between stationary points of the splitting model and the original
  inf-convolution model. We apply our theory to characterize stationary points of
  the penalty objective, which is minimized by the elastic averaging SGD (EASGD) method
  for distributed training, showing that perfect consensus between the workers is
  attainable via a finite penalty parameter. Numerically, we demonstrate the practical
  relevance of the proposed approach on the important task of distributed training
  of deep neural networks.
