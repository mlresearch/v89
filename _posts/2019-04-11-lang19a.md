title: Block Stability for MAP Inference
abstract: Recent work (Lang et al., 2018) has shown that some popular approximate
  MAP inference algorithms perform very well when the input instance is stable. The
  simplest stability condition assumes that the MAP solution does not change at all
  when some of the pairwise potentials are adversarially perturbed. Unfortunately,
  this strong condition does not seem to hold in practice. We introduce a significantly
  more relaxed condition that only requires portions of an input instance to be stable.
  Under this block stability condition, we prove that the pairwise LP relaxation is
  persistent on the stable blocks. We complement our theoretical results with an evaluation
  of real-world examples from computer vision, and we find that these instances have
  large stable regions.
