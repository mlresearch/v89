title: Two-temperature logistic regression based on the Tsallis divergence
abstract: We develop a variant of multiclass logistic regression that is significantly
  more robust to noise. The algorithm has one weight vector per class and the surrogate
  loss is a function of the linear activations (one per class). The surrogate loss  of
  an example with linear activation vector $\mathbf{a}$ and class $c$ has the form
  $-\log_{t_1} \exp_{t_2} (a_c - G_{t_2}(\mathbf{a}))$ where the two temperatures
  $t_1$ and $t_2$ “temper” the $\log$ and $\exp$, respectively, and $G_{t_2}(\mathbf{a})$
  is a scalar value that generalizes the log-partition function. We motivate this
  loss using the Tsallis divergence. Our method allows transitioning between non-convex
  and convex losses by the choice of the temperature parameters. As the temperature
  $t_1$ of the logarithm becomes smaller than the temperature $t_2$ of the exponential,
  the surrogate loss becomes “quasi convex”. Various tunings of the temperatures recover
  previous methods and tuning the degree of non-convexity is crucial in the experiments.
  In particular, quasi-convexity and boundedness of the loss provide significant robustness
  to the outliers. We explain this by showing that $t_1 < 1$ caps the surrogate loss
  and $t_2 >1$ makes the predictive distribution have a heavy tail.  We show that
  the surrogate loss is Bayes-consistent, even in the non-convex case. Additionally,
  we provide efficient iterative algorithms for calculating the log-partition value
  only in a few number of iterations. Our compelling experimental results on large
  real-world datasets show the advantage of using the two-temperature variant in the
  noisy as well as the noise free case.
