title: Are we there yet? Manifold identification of gradient-related proximal methods
abstract: In machine learning, models that generalize better often generate outputs
  that lie on a low-dimensional manifold. Recently, several works have separately
  shown finite-time manifold identification by some proximal methods.  In this work
  we provide a unified view by giving a simple condition under which any proximal
  method using a constant step size can achieve finite-iteration manifold detection.
  For several key methods (FISTA, DRS, ADMM, SVRG, SAGA, and RDA) we give an  iteration
  bound, characterized in terms of their variable convergence rate and a problem-dependent
  constant that indicates problem degeneracy.  For popular models, this constant is
  related to certain data assumptions, which gives intuition as to when lower active
  set complexity may be expected in practice.
