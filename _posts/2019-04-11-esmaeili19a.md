title: Structured Disentangled Representations
abstract: Deep latent-variable models learn representations of high-dimensional data
  in an unsupervised manner. A number of recent efforts have focused on learning representations
  that disentangle statistically independent axes of variation by introducing modifications
  to the standard objective function. These approaches generally assume a simple diagonal
  Gaussian prior and as a result are not able to reliably disentangle discrete factors
  of variation. We propose a two-level hierarchical objective to control relative
  degree of statistical independence between blocks of variables and individual variables
  within blocks. We derive this objective as a generalization of the evidence lower
  bound, which allows us to explicitly represent the trade-offs between mutual information
  between data and representation, KL divergence between representation and prior,
  and coverage of the support of the empirical data distribution. Experiments on a
  variety of datasets demonstrate that our objective can not only disentangle discrete
  variables, but that doing so also improves disentanglement of other variables and,
  importantly, generalization even to unseen combinations of factors.
