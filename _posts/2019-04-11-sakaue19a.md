title: Greedy and IHT Algorithms for Non-convex Optimization with Monotone Costs of
  Non-zeros
abstract: Non-convex optimization methods, such as greedy-style algorithms and iterative
  hard thresholding (IHT), for $\ell_0$-constrained minimization have been extensively
  studied thanks to their high empirical performances and strong guarantees. However,
  few works have considered non-convex optimization with general non-zero patterns;
  this is unfortunate since various non-zero patterns are quite common in practice.
  In this paper, we consider the case where non-zero patterns are specified by monotone
  set functions. We first prove an approximation guarantee of a cost-benefit greedy
  (CBG) algorithm by using the {\it weak submodularity} of the problem. We then consider
  an IHT-style algorithm, whose projection step uses CBG, and prove its convergence
  guarantee. We also provide many applications and experimental results that confirm
  the advantages of the algorithms introduced.
