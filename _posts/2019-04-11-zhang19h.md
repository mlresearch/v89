title: Recovery Guarantees For Quadratic Tensors With Sparse Observations
abstract: We consider the tensor completion problem of predicting the missing entries
  of a tensor. The commonly used CP model has a triple product form, but an alternate
  family of quadratic models which are the sum of pairwise products instead of a triple
  product have emerged from applications such as recommendation systems. Non-convex
  methods are the method of choice for learning quadratic models, and this work examines
  their sample complexity and error guarantee. Our main result is that with the number
  of samples being only linear in the dimension, all local minima of the mean squared
  error objective are global minima and recover the original tensor. We substantiate
  our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic and real-world data.
