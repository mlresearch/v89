title: Gaussian Process Latent Variable Alignment Learning
abstract: We present a model that can automatically learn alignments between high-dimensional
  data in an unsupervised manner. Our proposed method casts alignment learning in
  a framework where both alignment and data are modelled simultaneously. Further,
  we automatically infer groupings of different types of sequences within the same
  dataset. We derive a probabilistic model built on non-parametric priors that allows
  for flexible warps while at the same time providing means to specify interpretable
  constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with superior quantitative
  performance to the state-of-the-art approaches and provide examples to illustrate
  the versatility of our model in automatic inference of sequence groupings, absent
  from previous approaches, as well as easy specification of high level priors for
  different modalities of data.
