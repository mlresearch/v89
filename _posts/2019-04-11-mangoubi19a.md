title: 'Mixing of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on strongly log-concave distributions 2:
  Numerical integrators'
abstract: We obtain quantitative bounds on the mixing properties of the Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm with target distribution in d-dimensional Euclidean
  space, showing that HMC mixes quickly whenever the target log-distribution is strongly
  concave and has Lipschitz gradients. We use a coupling argument to show that the
  popular leapfrog implementation of HMC can sample approximately from the target
  distribution in a number of gradient evaluations which grows like d^1/2 with the
  dimension and grows at most polynomially in the strong convexity and Lipschitz-gradient
  constants.   Our results significantly extend and improve on the dimension dependence
  of previous quantitative bounds on the mixing of HMC and of the unadjusted Langevin
  algorithm in this setting.
