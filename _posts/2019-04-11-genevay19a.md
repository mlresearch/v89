title: Sample Complexity of Sinkhorn Divergences
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and maximum mean discrepancies (MMD) are now routinely
  used in machine learning to compare probability measures.  We focus in this paper
  on Sinkhorn divergences (SDs), a regularized variant of OT distances which can interpolate,
  depending on the regularization strength $\varepsilon$, between OT ($\varepsilon=0$)
  and MMD ($\varepsilon=\infty$). Although the tradeoff induced by that regularization
  is now well understood computationally (OT, SDs and MMD require respectively $O(n^3\log
  n)$, $O(n^2)$ and $n^2$ operations given a sample size $n$), much less is known
  in terms of their sample complexity, namely the gap between these quantities, when
  evaluated using finite samples vs. their respective densities. Indeed, while the
  sample complexity of OT and MMD stand at two extremes, $1/n^{1/d}$ for OT in dimension
  $d$ and $1/\sqrt{n}$ for MMD, that for SDs has only been studied empirically. In
  this paper, we (i) derive a bound on the approximation error made with SDs when
  approximating OT as a function of the regularizer $\varepsilon$, (ii) prove that
  the optimizers of regularized OT are bounded in a Sobolev (RKHS) ball independent
  of the two measures and (iii) provide the first sample complexity bound for SDs,
  obtained,by reformulating SDs as a maximization problem in a RKHS. We thus obtain
  a scaling in $1/\sqrt{n}$ (as in MMD), with a constant that depends however on $\varepsilon$,
  making the bridge between OT and MMD complete.
