title: Learning Natural Programs from a Few Examples in Real-Time
abstract: 'Programming by examples (PBE) is a rapidly growing subfield of AI, that
  aims to synthesize user-intended programs using input-output examples from the task.
  As users can provide only a few I/O examples, capturing user-intent accurately and
  ranking user-intended programs over other programs is challenging even in the simplest
  of the domains. Commercially deployed PBE systems often require years of engineering
  effort and domain expertise to devise ranking heuristics for real-time synthesis
  of accurate programs. But such heuristics may not cater to new domains, or even
  to a different segment of users from the same domain. In this work, we develop a
  novel, real-time, ML-based program ranking algorithm that enables synthesis of natural,
  user-intended, personalized programs. We make two key technical contributions: 1)
  a new technique to embed programs in a vector space making them amenable to ML-formulations,
  2) a novel formulation that interleaves program search with ranking, enabling real-time
  synthesis of accurate user-intended programs. We implement our solution in the state-of-the-art
  PROSE framework. The proposed approach learns the intended program with just {\em
  one} I/O example in a variety of real-world string/date/number manipulation tasks,
  and outperforms state-of-the-art neural synthesis methods along multiple metrics.'
