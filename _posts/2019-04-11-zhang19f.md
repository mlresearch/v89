title: Low-Precision Random Fourier Features for Memory-constrained Kernel Approximation
abstract: We investigate how to train kernel approximation methods that generalize
  well under a memory budget. Building on recent theoretical work, we define a measure
  of kernel approximation error which we find to be more predictive of the empirical
  generalization performance of kernel approximation methods than conventional metrics.
  An important consequence of this definition is that a kernel approximation matrix
  must be high rank to attain close approximation. Because storing a high-rank approximation
  is memory intensive, we propose using a low-precision quantization of random Fourier
  features (LP-RFFs) to build a high-rank approximation under a memory budget. Theoretically,
  we show quantization has a negligible effect on generalization performance in important
  settings. Empirically, we demonstrate across four benchmark datasets that LP-RFFs
  can match the performance of full-precision RFFs and the Nystr√∂m method, with 3x-10x
  and 50x-460x less memory, respectively.
