title: Distilling Policy Distillation
abstract: The transfer of knowledge from one policy to another is an important tool
  in Deep Reinforcement Learning. This process, referred to as distillation, has been
  used to great success, for example, by enhancing the optimisation of agents, leading
  to stronger performance faster, on harder domains. Despite the widespread use and
  conceptual simplicity of distillation, many different formulations are used in practice,
  and the subtle variations between them can often drastically change the performance
  and the resulting objective that is being optimised. In this work, we rigorously
  explore the entire landscape of policy distillation, comparing the motivations and
  strengths of each variant through theoretical and empirical analysis. Our results
  point to three distillation techniques, that are preferred depending on specifics
  of the task. Specifically a newly proposed expected entropy regularised distillation
  allows for quicker learning in a wide range of situations, while still guaranteeing
  convergence.
