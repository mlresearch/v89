title: 'Exponential convergence rates for Batch Normalization: The power of length-direction
  decoupling in non-convex optimization'
abstract: Normalization techniques such as Batch Normalization have been applied very
  successfully for training deep neural networks. Yet, despite its apparent empirical
  benefits, the reasons behind the success of Batch Normalization are mostly hypothetical.
  We here aim to provide a more thorough theoretical understanding from a classical
  optimization perspective. Our main contribution towards this goal is the identification
  of various problem instances in the realm of machine learning where Batch Normalization
  can provably accelerate optimization. We argue that this acceleration is due to
  the fact that Batch Normalization splits the optimization task into optimizing length
  and direction of the parameters separately. This allows gradient-based methods to
  leverage a favourable global structure in the loss landscape that we prove to exist
  in Learning Halfspace problems and neural network training with Gaussian inputs.
  We thereby turn Batch Normalization from an effective practical heuristic into a
  provably converging algorithm for these settings. Furthermore, we substantiate our
  analysis with empirical evidence that suggests the validity of our theoretical results
  in a broader context.
