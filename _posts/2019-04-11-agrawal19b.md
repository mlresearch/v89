title: 'ABCD-Strategy: Budgeted Experimental Design for Targeted Causal Structure
  Discovery'
abstract: Determining the causal structure of a set of variables is critical for both
  scientific inquiry and decision-making. However, this is often challenging in practice
  due to limited interventional data. Given that randomized experiments are usually
  expensive to perform, we propose a general framework and theory based on optimal
  Bayesian experimental design to select experiments for targeted causal discovery.
  That is, we assume the experimenter is interested in learning some function of the
  unknown graph (e.g., all descendants of a target node) subject to design constraints
  such as limits on the number of samples and rounds of experimentation. While it
  is in general computationally intractable to select an optimal experimental design
  strategy, we provide a tractable implementation with provable guarantees on both
  approximation and optimization quality based on submodularity. We evaluate the efficacy
  of our proposed method on both synthetic and real datasets, thereby demonstrating
  that our method realizes considerable performance gains over baseline strategies
  such as random sampling.
