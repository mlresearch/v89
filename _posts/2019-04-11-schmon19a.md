title: Bernoulli Race Particle Filters
abstract: When the weights in a particle filter are not available analytically, standard
  resampling methods cannot be employed. To circumvent this problem state-of-the-art
  algorithms replace the true weights with non-negative unbiased estimates. This algorithm
  is still valid but at the cost of higher variance of the resulting filtering estimates
  in comparison to a particle filter using the true weights. We propose here a novel
  algorithm that allows for resampling according to the true intractable weights when
  only an unbiased estimator of the weights is available. We demonstrate our algorithm
  on several examples.
