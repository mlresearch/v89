title: Batched Stochastic Bayesian Optimization via Combinatorial Constraints Design
abstract: In many high-throughput experimental design settings, such as those common
  in biochemical engineering, batched queries are often more cost effective than one-by-one
  sequential queries. Furthermore, it is often not possible to directly choose items
  to query. Instead, the experimenter specifies a set of constraints that generates
  a library of possible items, which are then selected stochastically. Motivated by
  these considerations, we investigate \emph{Batched Stochastic Bayesian Optimization}
  (BSBO), a novel Bayesian optimization scheme for choosing the constraints in order
  to guide exploration towards items with greater utility. We focus on \emph{site-saturation
  mutagenesis}, a prototypical setting of BSBO in biochemical engineering, and propose
  a natural objective function for this problem. Importantly, we show that our objective
  function can be efficiently decomposed as a difference of submodular functions (DS),
  which allows us to employ DS optimization tools to greedily identify sets of constraints
  that increase the likelihood of finding items with high utility. Our experimental
  results show that our algorithm outperforms common heuristics on both synthetic
  and two real protein datasets.
