title: An Optimal Algorithm for Stochastic and Adversarial Bandits
abstract: 'We derive an algorithm that achieves the optimal (up to constants) pseudo-regret
  in both adversarial and stochastic multi-armed bandits without prior knowledge of
  the regime and time horizon. The algorithm is based on online mirror descent with
  Tsallis entropy regularizer. We provide a complete characterization of such algorithms
  and show that Tsallis entropy with power $\alpha = 1/2$ achieves the goal. In addition,
  the proposed algorithm enjoys improved regret guarantees in two intermediate regimes:
  the moderately contaminated stochastic regime defined by Seldin and Slivkins [22]
  and the stochastically constrained adversary studied by Wei and Luo [26]. The algorithm
  also obtains adversarial and stochastic optimality in the utility-based dueling
  bandit setting. We provide empirical evaluation of the algorithm demonstrating that
  it outperforms Ucb1 and Exp3 in stochastic environments. In certain adversarial
  regimes the algorithm significantly outperforms Ucb1 and Thompson Sampling, which
  exhibit close to linear regret.'
