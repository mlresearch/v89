title: Bandit Online Learning with Unknown Delays
abstract: This paper deals with bandit online learning, where feedback of unknown
  delay can emerge in non-stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) and bandit convex optimization
  (BCO) settings. MAB and BCO require only values of the objective function to become
  available through feedback, and are used to estimate the gradient appearing in the
  corresponding iterative algorithms.  Since the challenging case of feedback with
  unknown delays prevents one from constructing the sought gradient estimates, existing
  MAB and BCO algorithms become intractable. Delayed exploration, exploitation, and
  exponential (DEXP3) iterations, along with delayed bandit gradient descent (DBGD)
  iterations are developed for MAB and BCO with unknown delays, respectively. Based
  on a unifying analysis framework, it is established that both DEXP3 and DBGD guarantee
  an $\tilde{\cal O}\big( \sqrt{K(T+D)} \big)$ regret, where $D$ denotes the delay
  accumulated over $T$ slots, and $K$ represents the number of arms in MAB or the
  dimension of decision variables in BCO. Numerical tests using both synthetic and
  real data validate DEXP3 and DBGD.
