title: Confidence-based Graph Convolutional Networks for Semi-Supervised Learning
abstract: Predicting properties of nodes in a graph is an important problem with applications
  in a variety of domains. Graph-based Semi Supervised Learning (SSL) methods aim
  to address this problem by labeling a small subset of the nodes as seeds, and then
  utilizing the graph structure to predict label scores for the rest of the nodes
  in the graph. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive
  performance on the graph-based SSL task. In addition to label scores, it is also
  desirable to have confidence scores associated with them. Unfortunately, confidence
  estimation in the context of GCN has not been previously explored. We fill this
  important gap in this paper and propose ConfGCN, which estimates labels scores along
  with their confidences jointly in GCN-based setting. ConfGCN uses these estimated
  confidences to determine the influence of one node on another during neighborhood
  aggregation, thereby acquiring anisotropic capabilities. Through extensive analysis
  and experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that ConfGCN is able to outperform
  state-of-the-art baselines. We have made ConfGCNâ€™s source code available to encourage
  reproducible research.
