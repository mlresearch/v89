title: Accelerated Decentralized Optimization with Local Updates for Smooth and Strongly
  Convex Objectives
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing a sum of smooth and strongly
  convex functions split over the nodes of a network in a decentralized fashion. We
  propose the algorithm ESDACD, a decentralized accelerated algorithm that only requires
  local synchrony. Its rate depends on the condition number $\kappa$ of the local
  functions  as well as the network topology and delays. Under mild assumptions on
  the topology of the graph, ESDACD takes a time $O((\tau_{\max} + \Delta_{\max})\sqrt{{\kappa}/{\gamma}}\ln(\epsilon^{-1}))$
  to reach a precision $\epsilon$ where $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the graph,
  $\tau_{\max}$ the maximum communication delay and $\Delta_{\max}$ the maximum computation
  time. Therefore, it matches the rate of SSDA, which is optimal when $\tau_{\max}
  = \Omega\left(\Delta_{\max}\right)$. Applying ESDACD to quadratic local functions
  leads to an accelerated randomized gossip algorithm of rate $O(  \sqrt{\theta_{\rm
  gossip}/n})$ where $\theta_{\rm gossip}$ is the rate of the standard randomized
  gossip. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first asynchronous algorithm with
  a provably improved rate of convergence of the second moment of the error. We illustrate
  these results with experiments in idealized settings.
