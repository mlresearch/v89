title: Probabilistic Semantic Inpainting with Pixel Constrained CNNs
abstract: 'Semantic inpainting is the task of inferring missing pixels in an image
  given surrounding pixels and high level image semantics. Most semantic inpainting
  algorithms are deterministic: given an image with missing regions, a single inpainted
  image is generated. However, there are often several plausible inpaintings for a
  given missing region. In this paper, we propose a method to perform probabilistic
  semantic inpainting by building a model, based on PixelCNNs, that learns a distribution
  of images conditioned on a subset of visible pixels. Experiments on the MNIST and
  CelebA datasets show that our method produces diverse and realistic inpaintings.'
