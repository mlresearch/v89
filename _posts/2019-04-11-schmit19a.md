title: Optimal Testing in the Experiment-rich Regime
abstract: 'Motivated by the widespread adoption of large-scale A/B testing in industry,
  we propose a new experimentation framework for the setting where potential experiments
  are abundant (i.e., many hypotheses are available to test), and observations are
  costly; we refer to this as the experiment-rich regime.  Such scenarios require
  the experimenter to internalize the opportunity cost of assigning a sample to a
  particular experiment.  We fully characterize the optimal policy and give an algorithm
  to compute it. Furthermore, we develop a simple heuristic that also provides intuition
  for the optimal policy.  We use simulations based on real data to compare both the
  optimal algorithm and the heuristic to other natural alternative experimental design
  frameworks.  In particular, we discuss the paradox of power: high-powered "classical"
  tests can lead to highly inefficient sampling in the experiment-rich regime.'
