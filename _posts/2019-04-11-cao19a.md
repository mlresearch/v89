title: Nearly Optimal Adaptive Procedure with Change Detection for Piecewise-Stationary
  Bandit
abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a class of online learning problems where a
  learning agent aims to maximize its expected cumulative reward while repeatedly
  selecting to pull arms with unknown reward distributions. We consider a scenario
  where the reward distributions may change in a piecewise-stationary fashion at unknown
  time steps. We show that by incorporating a simple change-detection component with
  classic UCB algorithms to detect and adapt to changes, our so-called M-UCB algorithm
  can achieve nearly optimal regret bound on the order of $O(\sqrt{MKT\log T})$, where
  $T$ is the number of time steps, $K$ is the number of arms, and $M$ is the number
  of stationary segments.  Comparison with the best available lower bound shows that
  our M-UCB is nearly optimal in $T$ up to a logarithmic factor.  We also compare
  M-UCB with the state-of-the-art algorithms in numerical experiments using a public
  Yahoo! dataset and a real-world digital marketing dataset to demonstrate its superior
  performance.
