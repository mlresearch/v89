title: Fast Gaussian process based gradient matching for parameter identification
  in systems of nonlinear ODEs
abstract: Parameter identification and comparison of dynamical systems is a challenging
  task in many fields. Bayesian approaches based on Gaussian process regression over
  time-series data have been successfully applied to infer the parameters of a dynamical
  system without explicitly solving it. While the benefits in computational cost are
  well established, the theoretical foundation has been criticized in the past. We
  offer a novel interpretation which leads to a better understanding, improvements
  in state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and robustness and a decrease
  in run time due to a more efficient setup for general nonlinear dynamical systems.
