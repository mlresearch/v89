title: Kernel Exponential Family Estimation via Doubly Dual Embedding
abstract: We investigate penalized maximum log-likelihood estimation for exponential
  family distributions whose natural parameter resides in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
  space. Key to our approach is a novel technique, doubly dual embedding, that avoids
  computation of the partition function. This technique also allows the development
  of a flexible sampling strategy that amortizes the cost of Monte-Carlo sampling
  in the inference stage. The resulting estimator can be easily generalized to kernel
  conditional exponential families. We establish a connection between kernel exponential
  family estimation and MMD-GANs, revealing a new perspective for understanding GANs.
  Compared to the score matching based estimators, the proposed method improves both
  memory and time efficiency while enjoying stronger statistical properties, such
  as fully capturing smoothness in its statistical convergence rate while the score
  matching estimator appears to saturate. Finally, we show that the proposed estimator  empirically
  outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both kernel exponential family estimation
  and its conditional extension.
