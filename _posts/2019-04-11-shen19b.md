title: Complexities in Projection-Free Stochastic Non-convex Minimization
abstract: For constrained nonconvex minimization problems, we propose a meta stochastic
  projection-free optimization algorithm, named Normalized Frank Wolfe Updating, that
  can take any Gradient Estimator (GE) as input. For this algorithm, we prove its
  convergence rate, regardless of the choice of GE. Using a sophisticated GE, this
  algorithm can significantly improve the Stochastic First order Oracle (SFO) complexity.
  Further, a new second order GE strategy is proposed to incorporate curvature information,
  which enjoys theoretical advantage over the first order ones. Besides, this paper
  also provides a lower bound of Linear-optimization Oracle (LO) queried to achieve
  an approximate stationary point. Simulation studies validate our analysis under
  various parameter settings.
