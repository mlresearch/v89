title: Multi-Task Time Series Analysis applied to Drug Response Modelling
abstract: Time series models such as dynamical systems are frequently fitted to a
  cohort of data, ignoring variation between individual entities such as patients.
  In this paper we show how these models can be personalised to an individual level
  while retaining statistical power, via use of multi-task learning (MTL). To our
  knowledge this is a novel development of MTL which applies to time series both with
  and without control inputs. The modelling framework is demonstrated on a physiological
  drug response problem which results in improved predictive accuracy and uncertainty
  estimation over existing state-of-the-art models.
