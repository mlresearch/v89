title: Boosting Transfer Learning with Survival Data from Heterogeneous Domains
abstract: Survival models derived from health care data are an important support to
  inform critical screening and therapeutic decisions. Most models however, do not
  generalize to populations outside the marginal and conditional distribution assumptions
  for which they were derived. This presents a significant barrier to the deployment
  of machine learning techniques into wider clinical practice as most medical studies
  are data scarce, especially for the analysis of time-to-event outcomes. In this
  work we propose a survival prediction model that is able to improve predictions
  on a small data domain of interest - such as a local hospital - by leveraging related
  data from other domains - such as data from other hospitals. We construct an ensemble
  of weak survival predictors which iteratively adapt the marginal distributions of
  the source and target data such that similar source patients contribute to the fit
  and ultimately improve predictions on target patients of interest. This represents
  the first boosting-based transfer learning algorithm in the survival analysis literature.
  We demonstrate the performance and utility of our algorithm on synthetic and real
  healthcare data collected at various locations.
