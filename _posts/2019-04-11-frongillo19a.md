title: Multi-Observation Regression
abstract: Given a data set of $(x,y)$ pairs, a common learning task is to fit a model
  predicting $y$ (a label or dependent variable) conditioned on $x$. This paper considers
  the similar but much less-understood problem of modeling “higher-order” statistics
  of $y$’s distribution conditioned on $x$. Such statistics are often challenging
  to estimate using traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) approaches. We develop
  and theoretically analyze an ERM-like approach with multi-observation loss functions.
  We propose four algorithms formalizing the concept of ERM for this problem, two
  of which have statistical guarantees in settings allowing both slow and fast convergence
  rates, but which are out-performed empirically by the other two. Empirical results
  illustrate potential practicality of these algorithms in low dimensions and significant
  improvement over standard approaches in some settings.
