title: 'Structured Robust Submodular Maximization: Offline and Online Algorithms'
abstract: Constrained submodular function maximization has been used in subset selection
  problems such as selection of most informative sensor locations. While these models
  have been quite popular, the solutions obtained via this approach are unstable to
  perturbations in data defining the submodular functions. Robust submodular maximization
  has been proposed as a richer model that aims to overcome this discrepancy as well
  as increase the modeling scope of submodular optimization. In this work, we consider
  robust submodular maximization with structured combinatorial constraints and give
  efficient algorithms with provable guarantees. Our approach is applicable to constraints
  defined by single or multiple matroids, knapsack as well as distributionally robust
  criteria. We consider both the offline setting where the data defining the problem
  is known in advance as well as the online setting where the input data is revealed
  over time. For the offline setting, we give a nearly optimal bi-criteria approximation
  algorithm that relies on new extensions of the classical greedy algorithm. For the
  online version of the problem, we give an algorithm that returns a bi-criteria solution
  with sub-linear regret.
