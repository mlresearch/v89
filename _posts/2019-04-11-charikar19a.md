title: Hierarchical Clustering for Euclidean Data
abstract: Recent works on Hierarchical Clustering (HC), a well-studied problem in
  exploratory data analysis, have focused on optimizing various objective functions
  for this problem under arbitrary similarity measures. In this paper we take the
  first step and give novel scalable algorithms for this problem tailored to Euclidean
  data in R^d and under vector-based similarity measures, a prevalent model in several
  typical machine learning applications. We focus primarily on the popular Gaussian
  kernel and present our results through the lens of the objective introduced recently
  by [MW’17]. We show the approximation factor in [MW’17] can be improved for Euclidean
  data. We further demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that our algorithms
  scale to very high dimension d, while outperforming average-linkage and showing
  competitive results against other less scalable approaches.
