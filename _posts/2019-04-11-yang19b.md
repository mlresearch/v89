title: Multi-Order Information for Working Set Selection of Sequential Minimal Optimization
abstract: A new working set selection method for sequential minimal optimization (SMO)
  is proposed in this paper. Instead of the method adopted in the current version
  of LIBSVM, which uses the second order information of the objective function to
  choose the violating pairs, we suggest a new method where a higher order information
  is considered. It includes the descent degree of the objective function and the
  stride of variables update. Many experimental results show, in contrast to LIBSVM,
  the number of iterations obtained by the proposed method is less in the vast majority
  of cases and the training of support vector machines (SVMs) is sped up. Meanwhile,
  the convergence of the proposed approach can be guaranteed and its accuracy is at
  the same level as LIBSVMâ€™s.
