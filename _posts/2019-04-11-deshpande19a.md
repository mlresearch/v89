title: On Euclidean k-Means Clustering with alpha-Center Proximity
abstract: "$k$-means clustering is NP-hard in the worst case but previous work has
  shown efficient algorithms assuming the optimal $k$-means clusters are \\emph{stable}
  under additive or multiplicative perturbation of data. This has two caveats. First,
  we do not know how to efficiently verify this property of optimal solutions that
  are NP-hard to compute in the first place. Second, the stability assumptions required
  for polynomial time $k$-means algorithms are often unreasonable when compared to
  the ground-truth clusters in real-world data. A consequence of multiplicative perturbation
  resilience is \\emph{center proximity}, that is, every point is closer to the center
  of its own cluster than the center of any other cluster, by some multiplicative
  factor $\\alpha > 1$.  We study the problem of minimizing the Euclidean $k$-means
  objective only over clusterings that satisfy $\\alpha$-center proximity. We give
  a simple algorithm to find the optimal $\\alpha$-center-proximal $k$-means clustering
  in running time exponential in $k$ and $1/(\\alpha - 1)$ but linear in the number
  of points and the dimension. We define an analogous $\\alpha$-center proximity condition
  for outliers, and give similar algorithmic guarantees for $k$-means with outliers
  and $\\alpha$-center proximity. On the hardness side we show that for any $\\alpha’
  > 1$, there exists an $\\alpha \\leq \\alpha’$, $(\\alpha >1)$, and an $\\e_0 >
  0$ such that minimizing the $k$-means objective over clusterings that satisfy $\\alpha$-center
  proximity is NP-hard to approximate within a multiplicative $(1+\\e_0)$ factor."
