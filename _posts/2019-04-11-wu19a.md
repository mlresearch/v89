title: Lifelong Optimization with Low Regret
abstract: 'In this work, we study a problem arising from two lines of works: online
  optimization and lifelong learning. In the problem, there is a sequence of tasks
  arriving sequentially, and within each task, we have to make decisions one after
  one and then suffer corresponding losses. The tasks are related as they share some
  common representation, but they are different as each requires a different predictor
  on top of the representation. As learning a representation is usually costly in
  lifelong learning scenarios, the goal is to learn it continuously through time across
  different tasks, making the learning of later tasks easier than previous ones. We
  provide such learning algorithms with good regret bounds which can be seen as natural
  generalization of prior works on online optimization.'
